Like any rational human being, you probably have <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/20570/stickers-for-stackers-i-e-post-your-sticker-shots">an insatiable desire for Stack Overflow Trilogy stickers</a>. It's only natural.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://marcgravell.blogspot.com/2009/09/stickers-now-what-to-do-with-them.html" style="border-bottom:none;"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/trilogy-stickers-gravell1.jpg" width="600" alt="trilogy-stickers-gravell" title="trilogy-stickers-gravell" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>
But how do you get <i>your</i> hands on these sweet, sweet, hunks of colored vinyl?</p>
<p>
Good news! You can!</p>
<p>
Simply <b>mail a Self-Addressed Stamped Envelope</b> to:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Stack Overflow Stickers<br />
Stack Exchange, Inc<br />
110 William St, 28th Floor<br />
New York, NY 10038
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The returned envelope will contain one Stack Overflow, one Super User, and one Server Fault sticker. However, if you'd like all three stickers to be of one particular type, no problem; just indicate that preference somewhere on the envelope.</p>
<p>
If you run a <b>user group or company meeting</b> and you would like a batch of stickers to provide at your next meeting, please send a short letter on company/group letterhead requesting stickers to the above address. Also indicate how many you're requesting.</p>
<p>
If you are <b>outside the United States</b>, the concept of SASE is a bit tougher. You have two options here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Include US $1 in the envelope to cover international postage (currently $0.98 at the time I am writing this).
</li>
<li>Include an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_reply_coupon">International Reply Coupon</a> with your self-addressed envelope.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
One word of caution: if you are on the first two /user pages of any Trilogy site, a little birdie told me you might have free stickers coming your way, so hold off on mailing anything.</p>
<p>
<b>We'd like to get these stickers in the hands of as many people as possible, so don't be shy in requesting them</b> -- particularly if you know of a user group or meeting that would be interested, or any other opportunities to distribute them more effectively.</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p></p>

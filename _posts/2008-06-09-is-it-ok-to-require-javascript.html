<p>
Here's one decision we're pondering as we build stackoverflow, and I'd like to get your feedback on it:</p>
<p>
<b>Is it OK to require JavaScript to participate?</b></p>
<p>
Note that by "participate" I mean "edit, answer or ask a question". Of course passively reading a question and the associated answers will work fine without JavaScript enabled.</p>
<p>
In addition to the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/index.php/2008/05/potential-markup-and-editing-choices/">aforementioned WMD editor</a>, we're using <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> to build some cool interactive features into the site, most of which deal with asking and editing questions.</p>
<p>
I <a href="http://quotably.com/codinghorror/statuses/830271411">asked this question on Twitter</a> and got a "mostly yes" answer, with a few objections.</p>
<p>
While we do believe in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Enhancement">progressive enhancement</a>, it's possible that some of the features we're building for asking and editing may be so dynamic that they do not degrade well, if at all.</p>
<p>
What say you? Is it OK for a website in 2008 to <i>require</i> JavaScript for active (not passive) participation?</p>
<p /></p></p></p>

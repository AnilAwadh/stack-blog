<p>With <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites?sort=oldest">forty-three sites and counting</a>, there's no shortage of communities needing attention. Thank goodness there's also no shortage of enthusiastic users willing to volunteer their time to help their communities. But once in awhile a user stands out as truly exceptional. That's why I am really excited to announce that <a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/351/dori">Dori Smith</a> has joined us as a full-time member of our community management team.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7320" src="assets/Dori-Smith.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="324" /></p>
<p>You may have seen Dori in her role as moderator of <a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/">Ask Different</a>, the Apple Stack Exchange, but she is also actively involved in the <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/">Programmers Stack Exchange</a>, as well as <a href="http://superuser.com/">Super User</a>, <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/">English Language &amp; Usage</a>, and our own <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/">meta Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
<p>When I talked to Dori about joining our team, she was essentially the same person that comes across on the sites: even-tempered, well-spoken, self-motivated… and <em>just</em> outspoken enough to keep me (and the communities) on our toes.</p>
<p>Dori will be working out of Healdsburg, CA. Dori has a <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/dori">degree in Computer Science and speaks professionally</a> about a wide variety of topics. And, wow, has she ever authored <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_tc_2_0?rh=i%3Astripbooks%2Ck%3ADori+Smith&amp;keywords=Dori+Smith&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1298431656&amp;sr=8-2-ent&amp;field-contributor_id=B000APH4B8">an impressive collection of published articles and books</a>. Throw in her deep background as an experienced speaker, teacher, trainer, and community leader, and you have someone who is custom-built to be an outstanding community manager and technical evangelist!</p>
<p>Dori will start out with a unique role on our team. She is going to dedicate a significant portion of her time organizing the communities to help them jump-start some of their own promotional activities. We have long wanted to get these sites organized and involved in activities like <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/community-conference-sponsorships/">sending users to attend conferences</a>, speaker bureaus, blogger- and Twitter-outreach, sponsorships, and media relations. With Dori on the team, her experience will bring us a long way towards helping these communities excel with new and exciting programs. Welcome to the team, Dori!</p>

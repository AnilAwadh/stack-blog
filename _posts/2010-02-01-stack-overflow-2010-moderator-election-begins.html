<p>
After a <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/stack-overflow-2010-moderator-nominations/">week long nomination period</a>, we now have our <b>Stack Overflow 2010 Moderator candidates.</b> (To be eligible as a candidate, you had to have at least 10 total upvotes in the meta nomination thread. Downvotes were not counted in any way.)</p>
<p>
There were some suggestions that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote">Single Transferable Vote</a> system would work better than the simple "one user, one vote" system we <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/stack-overflow-moderator-voting-now-open/#comment-21408">used last time</a>. So, this time around, we're conducting the election a bit differently -- <b>you can cast <i>three</i> votes</b> instead of a single vote. </p>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ballot-box.jpg" alt="" title="ballot-box" width="373" height="433" /></p>
<p>
Some ground rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>To be eligible to vote, you must be a Stack Overflow user with at least <b>200 reputation</b>.
</li>
<li>The list of candidates is shown in random order every time it is presented.
</li>
<li>Only three votes can be cast per user. No, they can’t be undone. Cast votes in the order of most desirable candidates first. Your first vote has the most weight.
</li>
<li>After a week, the candidate with most weighted votes will be elected the new Stack Overflow moderator.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For those users who don’t follow the blog, we are planning to send out a user alert (similar to the badge award alerts) tomorrow to let them know the voting page is available.</p>
<p>
Remember, we’re looking for a good moderator; someone who is above all:</p>
<ul>
<li>patient and fair
</li>
<li>leads by example
</li>
<li>shows respect for their fellow programmers in their actions and words
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I suggest examining the candidates’ user pages to get a sense of what kind of moderator they might make.</p>
<p>
I cast my vote; <b><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/vote-moderator">have you cast yours?</a></b></p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p>

<p>Our "third place", after a <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/third-place-chat-beta-preview/">successful three day beta preview</a>, is now on the final path to launch.</p>
<p>What is <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/do-trilogy-sites-need-a-third-place/">this mythical third place</a> I speak of?</p>
<h2>Chat.</h2>

<p>Because you not only need a place to have <b>intelligent Q&A about managing your finances</b>, you need a place to talk <i>about</i> the place, and a less formal "third place" to collaborate in real time with the fellow members of your community.</p>

<p>This is a <b>permanent public beta</b>, meaning chat is now live on <i>one</i> site in our network ... forever. We plan to roll out out chat on more sites in about 4 weeks, assuming the public beta goes reasonably well.</p>
<p>Before visiting this public chat beta, please bear in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>You must have a parent site account (in this case, <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com">Meta Stack Overflow</a>) in good standing with at least <b>20</b> reputation to talk in the chat.
</li>
<li>Before visiting chat, be sure you're logged in at the parent site, because we use that parent cookie to know who you are.
</li>
<li>Please read the <a href="http://chat.meta.stackoverflow.com/faq">chat faq</a>. And if you've already read it, humor me and <i>read it again</i> ... it has changed, and we will continue to improve it during the public beta.
</li>
<li>Hop on over to <a href="http://chat.meta.stackoverflow.com"><b>chat.meta.stackoverflow.com</b></a> and get to know the fellow members of your community!
</li>
</ol>
<p>Have fun -- and be sure to leave your feedback for us either on meta in a question <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/chat">tagged [chat]</a>, or in the chat itself in the appropriately named <a href="http://chat.meta.stackoverflow.com/rooms/77/chat-feedback">"Chat Feedback" room</a>.</p>

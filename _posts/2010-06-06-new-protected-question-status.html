At the behest of the Super User moderators, we've instituted a new question status of <b>protected</b>. A protected question is like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_policy">protected wikipedia article</a> -- it <b>no longer allows additions by anonymous users</b>.</p>
<p>
Protected questions are indicated in the standard question footer like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>protected by {moderator name} 3 days ago</h2>
<p>This question is protected to prevent "thanks", "me too!", and spam posts from new users. To answer it, you must have more than 10 reputation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We needed this because some of the more popular Super User questions attracted a lot of noise from random drive-by users who didn't understand how our system works -- users who helpfully provided so-called answers like "thanks, this worked for me!" or "I have this problem too, can anyone help?" And <i>lots</i> of them.</p>
<p>
Just check out <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/95685/windows-7-administrator-password-lost-how-can-i-login-windows-7-without-password">one example</a> of many:</p>
<p>
<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/superuser-deleted-answers.png" style="border-bottom:none"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/superuser-deleted-answers-small.png" alt="" title="superuser-deleted-answers-small" width="500" height="724" style="border:1px solid silver" /></a></p>
<p>
Just be thankful that these deletions you're seeing here are only visible if you have 10k rep on superuser.com.</p>
<p>
(I should also mention that I captured this full-page browser screenshot using <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/120266/how-can-i-take-browser-screenshots-at-a-higher-resolution-than-my-browser-support">a plug-in recommendation I found on Super User itself</a>.)</p>
<p>
While we used to lock these kinds of questions, that's not really what a lock was intended for. Locking a question is a bit of a nuclear option in this scenario, as locking prevents the question from getting votes, comments, or edits when the question itself wasn't even the problem.</p>
<p>
So, in the future, <b>if you see a question that is attracting a lot of drive-by noise answers, please flag it for moderator attention. We'll turn on protection.</b> The protection bar is extraordinarily low right now -- you only need >= 10 reputation to post an answer to a protected question -- but we think this is enough to cut down dramatically on answer noise for certain unlucky, but obviously popular, questions.</p>
<p>
(and, as always, thanks to <a href="http://superuser.com/about">our hard working Super User moderators</a> for coming up with this excellent idea)</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p>

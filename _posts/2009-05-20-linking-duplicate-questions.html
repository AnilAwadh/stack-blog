Today's update completes another <a href="http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/pages/1722-general/suggestions/28071-enforcing-link-to-original-exact-duplicate-question">top-rated UserVoice request</a> -- making it easier to explicitly link <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/handling-duplicate-questions/">duplicate questions</a> together. </p>
<p>
There are lots of small improvements that go with this build. We now <b>show the current close vote count</b> in the close menu, so you have some idea why the other 3k+ rep users think this question should be closed:</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/question-close-votes-shown.png" alt="question-close-votes-shown" title="question-close-votes-shown" style="border:1px solid silver;" /></p>
<p>
Remember, it takes <b>5</b> close votes from 3,000+ reputation users to close a question, but they don't all have to agree on the reason. (The reason with the most votes, however, will be shown when the question is finally closed. Yes yes, I know, you're programmers so you are immediately wondering what happens if all five votes are for five different reasons. Stop that right now!)</p>
<p>
If you select "exact duplicate" as a reason, you'll get <b>a dynamic as-you-type question duplicate lookup</b>. You can match on any word in the title, or the actual question id number here.</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/question-close-duplicate-selector.png" alt="question-close-duplicate-selector" title="question-close-duplicate-selector" style="border:1px solid silver;" /></p>
<p>
If the question reaches the 5 vote close threshold, and has enough duplicate votes, it will be closed with the reason of "exact duplicate", as before. But now a revision will be automatically edited into the post, <b>summarizing the voted duplicate questions at the top</b>:</p>
<p>

<p>
We tried to look at the existing way the community was dealing with <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/handling-duplicate-questions/">duplicate questions</a> and streamline it into as few steps as possible.</p>
<p>
Remember, in some cases we may want <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/handling-duplicate-questions/">duplicate questions</a> to stick around ...</p>
<blockquote><p>
There’s often benefit to having multiple subtle variants of a question around, as people <b>tend to ask and search using completely different words</b>, and the better our coverage, the better odds our fellow programmers can find the answer they’re looking for.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
... but if not, feel free to <b>flag for moderator attention any closed duplicates you think should be merged</b>. If the moderator agrees, he or she can merge the duplicates together without any loss of answers or comments.</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p></p>

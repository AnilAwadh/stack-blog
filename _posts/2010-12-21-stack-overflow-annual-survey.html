<p><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/stack-overflow-2010-analytics/" target="_blank">As you’ve seen from the site analytics</a>, Stack Overflow grew significantly in 2010.  We noticed some major technical shifts – more global visitors and an increase in use of Chrome as a web browser.  But, our visitors are more than just their web browser, operating system and screen resolutions, they are real people with real careers – valuable knowledge which isn’t measured by Google.  Some people may ask why we need to do a survey at all – so, taking poetic license on the 5 Whys, here's how we got to the root answer:</p>
<p>We need a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/StackOverflowSurvey" target="_blank">Stack Overflow Annual User Survey</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why? – To measure our user’s demographics</li>
<li>Why? – Potential advertisers judge our site by demographics to see if we fit in with their goals</li>
<li>Why? – You'll see more relevant ads increasing the value of our advertising</li>
<li>Why? – With more valued advertisers, we can spend more time developing awesome new features</li>
<li>Why? – New features create a better user experience, supporting Stack Overflow’s mission to make the internet a better place than we found it.</li>
</ol>

<p>The results of the survey will be released in a blog post at a future date.  You can also receive the final results sooner– simply provide your email at the end of the survey.  Your responses are kept completely anonymous and tabulated by SurveyMonkey.</p>

I've always envisioned the Stack Overflow story as a trilogy. You know, like **Star Wars**. The original, _non-sucky_ Star Wars, I mean. And now that I've secured the third domain name, we can complete our trilogy. I think the analogy works on several levels:

## [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com)




For **programmers**




The first. The fondly remembered classic. A model for so many sci-fi movies that followed.

## [serverfault.com](http://serverfault.com)




For **system administrators** and **desktop support professionals**




A darker, more serious movie. Some say the best in the series.

## [superuser.com](http://superuser.com)




For **computer enthusiasts** and **power users**




One word: _ewoks_. But also, Leia in a bikini. Still canon, but little odder than the earlier movies. In other words, things are going to get a little .. crazy .. in the finale.

I was thrilled to be able to secure the domain name superuser.com from fellow geek (and dual-class photographer / sysadmin) [Noah Beil](http://www.noahbeil.com/). As I've mentioned before, [naming is hard](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/it-stack-overflow-update-naming-is-hard/), and it's so rare to find a name that a) I like, and b) is available. Noah had actually heard of Stack Overflow and even used it a few times to find answers to JavaScript questions; of all the offers for the domain he had gotten over the years, this was the first one he felt was a good fit. 



At any rate, **if you wanted a community where (almost) anything goes, you're about to get exactly what you asked for in the form of superuser.com**. If your question has to do with _computers_, it will be allowed there.

But then again, _so are Ewoks_. So be careful what you ask for, I guess.

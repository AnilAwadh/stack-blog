Late last year, I had the pleasure of meeting Kyle Wiens, who recently launched <a href="http://iFixit.com">iFixit.com</a>. It's a community driven site providing step-by-step self repair guides for predominantly Apple hardware:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Repair is recycling! The best way to keep electronics out of landfills is to keep them working longer. Toxic electronic waste is a global problem that we are working to solve. Self repair saves you money and helps the environment!
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Kyle let me know that, as programmers themselves, many features of the site were "inspired by" Stack Overflow. Which we're totally cool with, since the iFixit mission of DIY self-repair guides is geek to the bone. <i>To the bone!</i> When I asked Kyle on Twitter if he was looking for iFixit to be inducted into our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/why-cant-you-have-just-one-site/">League of Web Justice</a>, he <a href="http://twitter.com/kwiens/status/6437390641">replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Naw, we're not superheroes. Maybe just a sidekick. Like Robin, or ... Aqualad?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Aqualad it is, then.</p>

<p>
Congratulations Kyle and team for launching <a href="http://iFixit.com">iFixit</a>. We're honored to have you as our sidekick!</p>
<p /></p></p></p>

<p>It’s been an amazing year for Stack Exchange, both as a network of experts and enthusiasts and as an organization. We launched twenty new sites, rolled out tons of user-requested features, and are helping 99% more visitors get answers than we were a year ago. </p>
<p>Last year, we celebrated the holidays on Gaming with <a href="http://blog.gaming.stackexchange.com/2011/12/holiday-2011-hat-dash-the-hattening/">Hat Dash,</a> where users collected virtual hats by doing various (good, helpful) things on the site. They were sort of like festive, temporary badges (and, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/07/stack-overflow-badge-feedbac/">like badges</a>, borrowed another good idea from the XBox - earning the ability to customize your avatar).</p>
<p>The response from that event was so positive, we decided to extend that to the <i>entire network</i><sup>1</sup> this holiday season. </p>
<h2><a href="http://winterba.sh/">Welcome to <i>Winter Bash 2012</i>!</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://winterba.sh/"><img src="assets/blog-image-1.png" title="Catch a snowflake on your tongue!" /></a></p>
<h3>What is Winter Bash?</h3>
<p>From <b>19 December to 4 January</b> you’ll be able to decorate your gravatar with a special hat. The hats used on Arqade smelled a bit funny, so we made up an all-new set of hats for you to earn this year. In fact, many of these “hats” aren’t even hats!  There are sunglasses, moustaches, masks and other assorted headgear.</p>
<p>Each hat has different criteria to unlock it, and there are even some <i>secret hats</i> that you won’t find out about until you happen to stumble across them accidentally.</p>

<p>Hats show up all over the site, wherever your gravatar is shown (well, except for a few places where they didn’t fit, like chat). To change which hat you’re wearing, or to admire your lovely hat collection, just visit <a href="http://winterba.sh">http://winterba.sh</a> or check out your user page:</p>

<p>You'll also get a notification when you earn a new item:</p>

<p>For all those of you who <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/grumpyhat.jpg">really hate hats</a>, there’s an "I hate hats" link in the Winter Bash dropdown. But give it a shot before you turn it off -- you might find a hat you like!</p>

<h3>Why are we doing this?</h3>
<p>Because it’s fun, and <a href="//blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/stack-overflow-where-we-hate-fun/">we love fun</a> - at least, constructive fun, in moderation, at the end of a long, exciting and eventful year. Also, hats are awesome.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>In 2013, our Stack Overflow community grew from 21.5 million to 26.9 million monthly visitors from 242 countries around the world. We're doing a lot to keep growing with the community -- we now have localized versions of Careers 2.0 for French and German audiences, we're developing <a title="Still in alpha - sign up if you wanna help break stuff!" href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/220264/help-us-test-the-alpha-version-of-our-ios-app">iOS</a> and <a title="In Beta - still breaky, less achy" href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/2014/01/stack-exchange-for-android-is-here/">Android</a> mobile apps for our entire network, and our first ever <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/02/cant-we-all-be-reasonable-and-speak-english/">localized</a> version of Stack Overflow with <a href="http://pt.stackoverflow.com/">the Portuguese site</a> currently in beta. As a way for us to make sure we're doing the most for our users and community on Stack Overflow, we conduct a survey every year to see what you're up to, how you're using our site and what else is on your mind. This year, we analyzed a survey sample of 7,500 responses from 96 countries. As a thank you for the time you spent filling it out, we donated an additional $12,000 to our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/12/stack-exchange-gives-back-2013-2/">Stack Exchange Charities</a>.</p>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<p><b style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">This is the second year we’re calling out mobile, and yes mobile is still growing.</b></p>
<p>While only 7.9% of you classified your occupation as a Mobile Application Developer, the majority of respondents (51.5%!) said that their company has a native mobile app. This is an increase from 2012 when 48.2% of respondents had a mobile app.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">Android continues to climb while iPhone declines</b></p>
<p>Not only is the Android Phone the most popular mobile device with 63.8% of respondents saying they have one, the most popular native mobile platform supported is an Android Phone app with 39.5%. The iPhone lost more traction with developers this year with 30.7% of respondents saying they own an iPhone compared to 35.2% in 2012.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">Working Remotely</b></p>
<p>As our Stack Exchange team is growing and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/02/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/">we have more employees working remote</a>, we added a number of questions about remote work. While only 10.6% of respondents said they are full-time remote, 63.9% of total respondents say they work remotely at least occasionally.</p>
<p>Here’s a special infographic to sum up our survey findings. If you’d like to do your own analysis you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16C6ZeNSvd-qIg45J9E-vx2YCsD8w5oZaSTUtJ-52e-w/edit?usp=sharing">download the survey results</a>.</p>

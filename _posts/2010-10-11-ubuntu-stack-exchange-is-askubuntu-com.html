<p>We're pleased to announce that ubuntu.stackexchange.com, in partnership with Canonical, Ltd, has become <a href="http://askubuntu.com">Ask Ubuntu</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://askubuntu.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/askubuntu-screenshot.png" alt="ask ubuntu" title="ask ubuntu" width="600" height="410" /></a></p>
<p>We're excited to see this come to fruition, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our mission is "let's make the internet better"; that's strikingly similar in scope to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_Ltd.">Canonical's mission</a>.
</li>
<li>It underscores the spirit of both Ubuntu and Stack Overflow in that we can all get along and learn from each other regardless of petty differences like <s>religion</s> technology stack
</li>
<li>We're big fans of open source software, as demonstrated in <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/free-vote-based-advertising-for-open-source-projects/">our free vote-based open source house ads</a> and our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/stack-overflow-gives-back/">yearly donations</a> and even <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/stack-overflow-sponsors-haproxy/">directly funding open source projects</a>.
</li>
<li>All of our data is released to the community in perpetuity <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/stack-overflow-creative-commons-data-dump/">under Creative Commons</a>
</li>
<li>We believe in <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/02/stack-overflow-2010-moderator-election-results/">regular moderator elections</a> and community self-governance
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to admit that I voted strongly against <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/unix-and-ubuntu-why-both/">having both Unix/Linux and Ubuntu sites</a>, but I deferred to the overall votes not to merge both inside and outside the company. We collectively said <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/fork-it/">Fork It</a>. It's clear now that given the strength and self-identification of the Ubuntu community, <i>they are the exception that proves the rule</i>.</p>
<p>Honestly, we get approached a lot for partnerships like this, but they don't usually go anywhere because we require ceding so much control back to the community. It is rare indeed to find such a complimentary relationship -- and we hope this one is beneficial to Ubuntu, our network, and the internet community at large.</p>
<p>But, as always, <b>you be the judge</b>. Be part of the community that governs the site:</p>
<h2><a href="http://askubuntu.com">askubuntu.com</a></h2>

We've appointed two new Super User moderators from the <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/14417/vote-for-super-user-moderator-poll">meta voting thread</a>.</p>

<p>
Welcome <a href="http://superuser.com/users/1548/ivo">Ivo</a> and <a href="http://superuser.com/users/2553/troggy">Troggy</a> as our newest <b>Super User community moderators!</b></p>
<p>
This also means that two existing Super User moderators, originally <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/08/congratulations-super-user-moderators/">appointed in August 2009</a>, will be retiring.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://superuser.com/users/705/thetxi">TheTXI</a> indicated to us via email that he no longer will be able to return to the Trilogy in any useful capacity. Serving as community moderator is completely voluntary; we understand that sometime life gets in the way of such things. Doug, we'll still be here if you ever come up for air, and you're always welcome back with pony-loving arms.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://superuser.com/users/187/splattne">Splattne</a> was unusual in that he was a moderator across <i>two</i> sites -- Server Fault and Super User. I was always a little uncomfortable asking Stefan to pull double duty. Because he's a mensch, of course he agreed, but I'm glad we can refocus so he doesn't have as much on his plate. He will of course continue to be a moderator on Server Fault, and Server Fault will hopefully benefit from the increased attention.</p>
<p>
As always, I recommend that new moderators (or anyone interested in the topic) read through <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/">A Theory of Moderation</a>.</p>
<p>
And don't forget we're still <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/stack-overflow-2010-moderator-nominations/">accepting nominations for a new Stack Overflow moderator</a> as well.</p>
<p /></p></p></p>

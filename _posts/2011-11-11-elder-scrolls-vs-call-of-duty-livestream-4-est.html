<p>As you may have noticed, we’re throwing a party over on <a href="http://gaming.stackexchange.com">the Gaming site</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10186" title="SkyrimVsMW3" src="assets/SkyrimVsMW3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="203" /></p>
<p>If you're not a gamer, you may not know that two huge games came out this week: <a href="http://www.elderscrolls.com/skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a> and <a href="http://www.callofduty.com/mw3">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a>.  Game launches are always big for <a href="http://gaming.stackexchange.com">gaming.stackexchange.com</a> because they're a unique opportunity to get Google search result share before it vanishes into the void of vBulletin and phpBB.  We wanted to throw a big launch party for this year's game release season, but we couldn't agree on which game to pick.</p>
<p>So instead of deciding, we made it a competition: <a href="http://skyrimvsmw3.com">Skyrim vs. Modern Warfare 3</a>.  Each game gets 7 days from when it launches to rack up as many views as it can.  Modern Warfare 3 has been out for 3 days and already racked up an impressive 10,000 views, and is still accelerating going into the weekend.  Skyrim just launched today, but is already starting to make its move.</p>
<p>To make it even more interesting, we're giving away <a href="http://skyrimvsmw3.com/prizes">cool gaming prizes</a>: free games for the top question and answer in each game, and one Grand Prize of a free console or graphics card chosen from everyone who contributed to the winning game (for more details, see <a href="http://skyrimvsmw3.com/rules">skyrimvsmw3.com/rules</a>).</p>
<h2>Livestream Launch Party</h2>
<p>To kick off the weekend, we're throwing a <strong>live party at Stack Exchange HQ in New York</strong>. We'll be live streaming the party and gameplay at <a href="http://skyrimvsmw3.com">skyrimvsmw3.com</a> starting at <strong>4pm EST</strong>.  You won't want to miss it.  We'll be featuring:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 gaming systems, including 2 projectors</li>
<li>Live color commentary &amp; interviews by a pair of comedians</li>
<li>Music, food, and beverages (not included in livestream)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're in New York and want to drop by, shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:team+gaming@stackexchange.com">team+gaming@stackexchange.com</a>.  Otherwise, tune into the livestream at <a href="http://skyrimvsmw3.com">skyrimvsmw3.com</a> starting at 4pm.</p>

Question and answer entry will be arguably the most crucial piece of stackoverflow. I used the post <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001116.html">Is HTML a Humane Markup Language?</a> as a form of collaborative research to determine what our Q&A editor should look like. Based on the (extensive!) feedback, I've reached three conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most programmers want either an HTML subset or <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus">Markdown</a>.
</li>
<li>Many prefer a formatting toolbar, although I view it as superfluous.
</li>
<li>Real-time preview of text formatting is an absolute must.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Good programmers never write what they can steal or borrow. With that in mind, I did some research and found the promising but unfortunately named <a href="http://wmd-editor.com/">WMD: The Wysiwym Markdown Editor</a> from AttackLab.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://wmd-editor.com/examples/splitscreen" style="border-bottom:none;"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/wmd-advanced-demo1.png" alt="wmd-advanced-demo1" title="wmd-advanced-demo1" border="0" /> </a></p>
<p>
I emailed <a href="http://attacklab.net/">AttackLab</a> and John Fraser was kind enough to respond with a code drop. Apparently there's going to be an open source release at <a href="http://wmd.googlecode.com/">http://wmd.googlecode.com/</a> any day now -- it will also include a post-processing callback we can use to do syntax highlighting. Here's <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/playground/showdown-highlight/">a demo someone hacked together</a> using WMD and a syntax highlighter:</p>

<p>
Adopting tools like these means we'd be very intimately tied to JavaScript on the client, of course, but it's hard for me to see how that's a problem on today's web.</p>
<p>
What do you think of these solutions? <b>Would they work for you when posting programming questions and answers on stackoverflow?</b></p>

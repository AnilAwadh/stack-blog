<p>
As mentioned on March 20th, we are <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/nominate-a-new-stack-overflow-moderator/">looking for a new Stack Overflow moderator</a> to be chosen by the Stack Overflow community itself.</p>
<p>
I walked through the first 30 comments to that post and gathered up the nominations (except the self-nominations and those who recused themselves), and voting is now open:</p>
<p>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/vote-moderator">http://stackoverflow.com/users/vote-moderator</a></p>
<ul>
<li>To be eligible to vote, you must be a Stack Overflow user with <b>200 reputation</b>.
</li>
<li>The list of candidates is shown in random order every time it is presented.
</li>
<li>Only one vote can be cast per user. (no, it can't be undone.)
</li>
<li>After a week, the candidate with the most votes will be elected the new Stack Overflow moderator.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For those users who don't follow the blog, we are planning to send out a user alert (similar to the badge award alerts) tomorrow to let them know the voting page is available.</p>
<p><p>
Remember, we're looking for a good moderator; someone who is above all</p>
<ul>
<li>patient and fair
</li>
<li>leads by example
</li>
<li>shows respect for their fellow programmers in their actions and words
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I suggest examining the candidates' user pages to get a sense of what kind of moderator they might make.</p>
<p>
I cast my vote; have you <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/vote-moderator">cast yours?</a></p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p>

We've been quite happy with the <a href="http://wmd-editor.com/">WMD Markdown editor</a> on Stack Overflow, kindly provided by the author, John Fraser of AttackLabs.</p>
<p>
However, there are definitely some outstanding bugs and issues with it that we'd like to fix. Progress on this front has been severely hampered by three problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>We only have obfuscated / minified versions of the WMD editor JavaScript code.
</li>
<li>I've been unable to reach John over the last 4 months.
</li>
<li>My JavaScript skills are average at best.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I'm not sure what happened to John, because he was super responsive and enthusiastic early on. He helped us out in a bunch of large and small ways with the WMD implementation. Originally <b>he planned to give me a drop of the un-obfuscated/minified WMD source</b>. But I never heard back from him, and he seems to have fallen off the face of the planet in the last 4-6 months. I've sent him brief emails like clockwork every few weeks, but there's no response. I hate to be naggy, but the alternatives are.. bad.</p>
<p>
So it is with great regret and heavy hearts that we undertake <b>the painful odyssey of manually un-minifying/obfuscating the WMD code ourselves</b>. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/13/chris-jester-young">Chris Jester-Young</a>, one of the earliest Stack Overflow users, has invested in a substantial amount of effort in this already. He's set up a git repository for our progress so far:</p>
<p><pre>
http://github.com/cky/wmd/tree
</pre>
<p>
(I should add that Chris, like myself, is a git noob, so be gentle!)</p>
<p>
Chris adds the following comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>
1. How will we coordinate the changes? Do we want to have a forum where people can post links to their repositories? (My repository is writable by me only -- but Git being a distributed VCS, this is not a problem, people just clone their own.) Or do you prefer to have a central repository that everyone checks into? In this case, I'm happy to check things into it -- or you can import it from my repository.</p>
<p>
2. How will we manage "knowledge transfer", such as it were? It would help people if I could write some notes (in a wiki or something, so others can update it) on how to go about the translation. Maybe use a community-modded Stack Overflow question dedicated to this? Ideas welcome.</p>
<p>
I'll try to get more changes checked in periodically, but I still have a ton of projects to clear, so getting the ball rolling with other coders would probably be a good idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>The easiest way forward is to somehow get a source code drop from John Fraser to start with.</b> If anyone knows him, or knows someone that knows him, can you please try to get in touch? Otherwise it's back to the salt mines of de-minifiying/obfuscating the JavaScript, until we get it all done.</p>
<p>
Beyond that, <b>I'd like to create a Stack Overflow branch of the WMD code</b>, under a very permissive license. We have some needs specific to our website, of course, but I'd like to give our modifications, improvements, and bugfixes back to the greater community as well.</p>
<p>
My gut feeling is that we should go with a "real" code hosting solution for this project, perhaps Google Code or the like..</p>

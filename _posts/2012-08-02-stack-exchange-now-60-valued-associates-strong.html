<p>Holy smokes... It's been over three and a half years since Jeff recruited <a title="Jarrod Dixon" href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00002/">Valued Associate #00002</a> to work full-time on building Stack Overflow. In that time, a lot has changed. Jeff's moved on to <a title="I'm holding out for the Star Craft to SO's C&amp;C" href="https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/213365532487983105">teasing us</a> with his next project, Jarrod's gone from spending his days knee-deep in code to managing the Core dev team and <a title="Oh yeah... Everyone uses Twitter now too. Not everything changes for the better." href="https://twitter.com/alexlmiller/status/225382060313935874">being big in Japan</a>. And there are now 60 full-time employees of Stack Exchange, many hired from <a title="Not just for breakfast anymore" href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/eating-our-own-careers-dogfood/">within the communities</a> on our sites.</p>
<p>It's been far too many months since <a title="Those Russian-Canadians have ways of making you talk. Vodka and poutine is a powerful combo..." href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/01/welcome-valued-associates-anna-rachel-carleejean-and-charles/">we last introduced</a> any of them, which is a real shame - these folks work hard keeping the lights on, and there's no reason to keep them locked in the basement <em>all</em> the time. So without further ado,</p>
<h2>New Valued Associates</h2>
<p><strong>Bart Silverstrim - Systems Administrator</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/28003/bart-silverstrim"><img src="assets/28003.png" alt="" width="208" height="58" /><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 4px;" src="assets/uRyZu.png" alt="" width="256" height="192" /></a></p>
<p>Bart is the newest addition to our Systems Administration Team.  Bart is married to his wonderful wife Norma, an English teacher in PA, and has a stepdaughter in college and a son obsessed with Pokemon. He has three cats named Ruby, Python and Mongo. He knows more about Star Trek than most, and is an aspiring author (try and find him at the local Barnes and Noble!)</p>

<p>As the new VP of community, Jay will oversee a combined team made up of our existing (and awesome) Chaos and Community teams.  Specifically, he's tasked with driving a 6-sigma confidence level in cloud fluffiness, a 15º improvement in rainbow arc, and a modest 15% lift in unicorn nobility.  He comes from a long, if accidental, career in <s>coal mining</s> financial services, where he started as a two-week temp answering phones, and most recently was a Managing Director of Capital Markets (whatever <em>that</em> means).  Prior to that, he studied Drama at Dartmouth College and <s>did</s> tried to do a lot of crossword puzzles.  Today, he's a proud husband and the father of the world's definitively most-awesome one-year-old <sup><small>[citation needed]</small></sup>.</p>

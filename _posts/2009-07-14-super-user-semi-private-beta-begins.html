<p><h2>The semi-private beta for <a href="http://superuser.com">Super User</a> has begun.</h2>
<p>
That's right, it is officially <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/">Ewok Time</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
At any rate, <b>if you wanted a community where (almost) anything goes, you&#8217;re about to get exactly what you asked for in the form of <a href="http://superuser.com">superuser.com</a></b>. If your question has to do with <i>computers</i>, it will be allowed there.</p></blockquote>

<p>
But then again, <i>so are Ewoks</i>. Be careful what you ask for, I guess.</p>
<p>
To get started, <a href="http://superuser.com">go to superuser.com</a> and sign up with your OpenID. Here's the password you'll need:</p>
<blockquote><p>
ewok.adventure
</p></blockquote>
<p>
<b>Be sure to <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/cross-site-account-associations/">visit the accounts tab of your user page</a> after you join, so you can get the +100 account association bonus on Super User!</b> (Note that this requires at least 200 rep, so be sure to initiate the association from the site where you have at least 200 reputation.)</p>
<p>
Leave any feedback/bugs on <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/">meta</a> -- just <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/superuser">tag them superuser</a>.</p>
<p>
Have fun -- this semi-private beta will run for approximately 2-3 weeks. Also, a little birdie told me that there <i>might</i> be the chance for a user who distinguishes him/herself during the private beta to be elevated to Super User moderator status, <i>if</i> the stars were to align just so...</p>

I've got some bad news and some good news.</p>
<p>
I like to start with the bad news, and you don't get a choice, so here goes:</p>
<p>
<b>There will be no podcasts for the next two weeks.</b></p>
<p>
Joel is on an extended vacation. Our apologies, but the logistics of recording remotely are too daunting. </p>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/beary-sorry.gif" alt="beary-sorry" title="beary-sorry" width="450" height="400" /></p>
<p>
Plus, we want Joel to <i>enjoy</i> his vacation, right? Me, I don't get a vacation. I have to work frantically with Jarrod, Geoff, and Jeremy on this Stack Overflow thing. Not that I'm bitter or anything. I'll just <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000963.html">set my desktop background</a> to something tropical. It's almost the same thing as a vacation. <i>Almost.</i></p>
<p>
But, I also bring you the promised good news!</p>
<p>
<b>You can sign up for the Stack Overflow beta</b>.</p>
<p>
Hooray! Huzzah! Because who <i>doesn't</i> love using buggy, incomplete websites filled with irate users?</p>

I asked around on Twitter and got a recommendation for a <a href="http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2008/02/stop-sharing-spreadsheets-start.html">Google Spreadsheet Form</a>. I looked at Wufoo and SurveyMonkey but their limits are too low. I must say I'm impressed with the Google docs spreadsheet form solution; it's working amazingly well. And it's so simple. Every time someone <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=pKxDW35algYdxrCnzW-OLag">visits the form</a> and signs up, a new row is created in the spreadsheet. Easy!</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p>

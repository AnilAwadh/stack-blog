I was invited to participate in <a href="http://herdingcode.com/?p=36">the latest Herding Code podcast</a>. </p>
<p>
<a href="http://herdingcode.com/?p=36" style="border-bottom:none;"><img src="assets/herding-code-logo.png" alt="herding-code-logo" title="herding-code-logo" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>
This was a fun one for me because I've known the four hosts of the program -- <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway">Jon Galloway</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kdente">Kevin Dente</a>, <a href="http://odetocode.com/">K. Scott Allen</a>, and <a href="http://lazycoder.com/">Scott Koon</a> -- through their blogs since forever, eventually meeting most of them in person. All of their blogs predate mine by years. I'd almost say we were <i>blog buddies</i>. If you could call people <i>blog buddies</i>. Which I don't think you can.</p>
<p>
At any rate, <b>I go into quite a bit of technical depth on Stack Overflow and some of the features that we have yet to implement, but have been hotly requested</b> -- definitely worth a listen if you want to go deep.</p>
<p>
Thanks for having me on!</p>
<p>
(oh, and listen past the end for a little audio easter egg that's sort of fun)</p>

<p>
This is the thirtieth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff sit down with Richard White of <a href="http://uservoice.com/">uservoice.com</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Richard worked as the user interface guy on calendar startup <a href="http://www.kiko.com/">Kiko.com</a>; UserVoice was originally inspired by Richard's work on Kiko, as a hybrid of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> and <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/">FogBugz</a>.</li>
<li>There are some thematic similarities between <a href="http://www.ideastorm.com/">Dell's IdeaStorm</a> and <a href="http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaHome">My Starbucks Idea</a> and UserVoice -- to some degree, UserVoice is users voting on the direction your software should take. Does software democracy work?</li>
<li>UserVoice isn't just for software -- there's also <a href="http://obamacto.uservoice.com/">Obama CTO</a> and <a href="http://rebuildtheparty.uservoice.com">Rebuild The Party</a>. This generated huge load and traffic, so if nothing else it was a good scaling test. The usual item has a maximum of 50 comments; one suggestion had 980 comments.</li>
<li>Our use of UserVoice is a bit anomalous; I prefer to (politely) decline requests that I think we won't get to. Is it more honest to let <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/KDente/archive/2005/03/13/394499.aspx">reasonable requests like this one</a> languish in the system for literally years, ala Microsoft's Connect, then to find out that they've been set to "wontfix" after 3 years? As a user myself, I find this behavior abhorrent.</li>
<li>We do plan to talk a bit less about building Stack Overflow and a bit more about our favorite questions on Stack Overflow.</li>
<li>Joel's favorite Stack Overflow question this week is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/297037/what-tricks-do-you-use-to-get-yourself-in-the-zone">What Tricks Do You Use to Get Yourself "In The Zone"?</a></li>
<li>UserVoice is a Ruby on Rails app, with approximately 6,000 lines of code. A large portion of that is unit tests.
</li>
<li>Jeff's favorite Stack Overflow question is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/210829/what-is-an-np-complete-problem">What is an NP-Complete Problem</a>. This is a followup to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001187.html">the blog post</a> where I demonstrate a sadly incomplete understanding of the concept of being NP-complete.</li>
<li>Joel notes that there are harder problems than NP-Complete, namely the halting problem. There's a great Stack Overflow question on this, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/235984/the-halting-problem-in-the-field">The Halting Problem in the Field</a></li>
<li>There are a lot of very hard problems in computer software that aren't necessarily NP-complete -- and we've had limited success "solving" them, such as speech and voice recognition. Furthermore, if the best algorithm we can come up with is something like n-cubed, is that a realistic solution?</li>
<li>UserVoice will be using Jan Rain's <a href="https://rpxnow.com/">RpxNow</a> to implement OpenID. We wondered how <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/">myopenid.com</a> would make money; their RpxNow service is the answer to that question. Now uservoice can mark that item off <a href="http://uservoice.uservoice.com/">their own uservoice page</a> -- it's the <a href="http://uservoice.uservoice.com/pages/general/suggestions/55">#2 most requested feature</a> by customers of User Voice.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also answered the following listener question:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chris Conway</strong>: "After 26 episodes of the podcast, will you ever take a turn to less self-reflexive discussion?"</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you'd like to submit a question to be answered in our next episode, record an audio file (90 seconds or less) and mail it to <a href="mailto:podcast@stackoverflow.com">podcast@stackoverflow.com</a>. You can <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/index.php/2008/05/recording-podcast-questions-using-your-telephone/">record a question</a> using nothing but a telephone and a web browser. We also have a dedicated phone number you can call to leave audio questions at <strong>646-826-3879</strong>.</p>

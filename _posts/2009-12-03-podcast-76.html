In this episode of the Stack Overflow podcast, Joel and Jeff discuss the Stack Overflow Careers philosophy, online community growth patterns, and how to tell if you're Sid Meier or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stack Overflow Careers is now <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/careers-now-open-for-businesses/">fully open for business</a>! Joel explains what it's all about, the proverbial <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/12/02.html">programmer search engine</a>. </li>
<li>One thing we have resisted is employer demand for a sort order of CVs by Stack Overflow reputation scores. This is sort of like colleges sorting incoming applications by SAT or ACT scores. We have a brief discussion about how the college admissions process relates (or doesn't) to job "admissions".</li>
<li>Joel shares his tips on what makes a CV / resume look good to him. And remember,<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1590598385"> Joel wrote the book on this stuff</a>! So in theory, at least, he knows what he's talking about! Fog Creek does a lot of hiring every year.</li>
<li>Now that we have a so-called "Careers" site on Stack Overflow, any perceived crossover between your professional life and online life is 100% intentional and by design -- <a href="http://www.cerebralmastication.com/?p=370">as correctly noted by the Cerebral Mastication blog</a>.</li>
<li>I am now required by law to link to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454">this amazing and hilarious SO post</a> (on the perils of matching XML with regex) which already has a stunning two thousand upvotes! It went hyper-viral.</li>
<li>Should we allow Facebook questions (or other questions specific to a website) on Super User? It's <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/30475/official-stance-on-facebook-questions-on-su">a bit complicated</a> because websites are becoming legitimate "software applications" in today's computing world, and even more so in the future. The line between a traditional software executable and a website is becoming less and less clear.</li>
<li>Discussing how you scale a community on Stack Exchange -- is it about having lots and lots of questions, or garnering a solid audience of experts?</li>
<li>There appears to be a distinct difference between the early, adolescent, and mature stages of a community. You have to plan for and adapt to each stage; there is no "one size fits all" approach. I'm reminded of Robert X. Cringely's classic essay <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000025.html">Commandos, Infantry, and Police</a>.</li>
<li>Joel's counterpoint is that <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=26064">maybe you're actually working with Sid Meier</a>. My counterpoint: everyone <em>wants</em> to think they're Sid Meier, but as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander_%28film%29">Highlander</a>, "There can be only one".</li>
<li>Per Joel, programming is not about knowing a programming language any more than being a concert pianist is about knowing how to read music. But is programming anything like creating art or music?</li>
<li>Joel is offering <strong>a free Fog Creek t-shirt of your choice for the best question asked next week</strong> -- so get those (audio only, please!) questions called or mailed in! And leave us a way to reach you.</li>
</ul>
<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Josh</strong> from Taiwan: "I'm looking to move from QA into programming. Is it better to know one language really well, or lots less well? Also, does Objective-C pass the Joel Test of knowing C?"</li>
</ol>
<p>

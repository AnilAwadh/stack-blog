<p>You're probably really stressed out about making dinner, huh? Have a ton of questions about cooking for large groups, vegetarian substitutes, and that deep frying experiment that went completely wrong? What a perfect time for us to remind you that <em>we have a site for that... it's called <a href="http://cooking.stackexchange.com/">Seasoned Advice</a>.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://meta.cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/1252/help-promote-this-site-ask-your-thanksgiving-large-group-cooking-questions-h">Reminding people</a> to turn to Stack Exchange sites at opportune times like this is a really easy way to help promote them. That doesn't necessarily mean waiting around until a holiday - it can be the release of a <a href="http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/589/now-that-lion-is-out-help-promote-ask-different">new operating system</a>, a <a href="http://skyrimvsmw3.com/">new video game</a> coming out, really anything that prompts a lot of questions is a good excuse to say "hey, you know there's this thing called Stack Exchange, right?" Excited about the new Twilight movie? Ask about it on <a href="http://scifi.stackexchange.com/">Sci Fi</a>. New edition of your favorite journal coming out? <a href="http://meta.stats.stackexchange.com/questions/1002/upcoming-journal-editions-read-em-and-ask-on-the-stack-and-get-prizes">Ask about it on one of our academic sites</a>. Need tips on how to work off all that extra stuffing and pumpkin pie you're going to eat tomorrow? Remind your friends that they can ask on <a href="http://fitness.stackexchange.com/">Fitness &amp; Nutrition</a>.</p>
<p>There are times and events that correspond with a lot of our sites, and they are all great excuses to do a little promoting. So when you (or whoever is slaving away in the kitchen tomorrow) has a question about cooking Thanksgiving dinner, remind them that they can ask about it on Stack Exchange!</p>

One thing we've been pitching a lot to VCs is our love for internet communities that are obsessive about <i>something</i>, where that something could be ... well, anything, really. I feel that the kind of expert communities that arise around a shared passion for <i>something</i> are not only fascinating but help the world at large, in that these experts produce a lot of highly relevant content that any average person can dip their toes in when they need advice about that particular topic.</p>
<p>
Our goal with the Stack Overflow engine, then, is to unlock this content and release expert communities from the Soviet-era phpBB and vBulletin software they've been trapped in for so many years. In other words, <b>better living through software!</b></p>
<p>
I was amused to discover <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news/man_on_internet_almost_falls_into">this hilarious Onion article</a> which exposes a hidden downside of these expert communities that Joel and I didn't discuss with VCs.</p>
<blockquote><p>
"I don't know how I wound up at that point, but thank God I escaped when I did," Gibson, 41, said Friday. "There I was, a grown man, planning a trip to the Mustard Museum in Wisconsin, when suddenly I heard a voice deep within me say, 'This is not what you want your life to be about.'"</p>
<p>
"It was like waking up from a bad dream," Gibson added. "A bad yellow and brown dream."</p>

<p>
Gibson's descent into the depths of mustard obsession started innocently enough, when he got involved in an Internet exchange about the best kind of mustard to use on a grilled bratwurst. When someone posted a link encouraging him to "click on this if you really want to spice things up," he took the stranger's advice and suddenly found himself on MustardMonster.com, a discussion group devoted to the cultivation, preparation, and enjoyment of the table-side condiment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Speaking of mustardmonster.com, I wanted to gather people's opinions about <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com">what sites are currently missing from the Trilogy</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We're trying to identify some gaps we have and possibly fill them, based on existing data. If you had to identify a theme of questions that tend to frequently get asked and closed as off-topic in the Trilogy (whether Stack Overflow, Server Fault, or Super User), repeatedly, what would that theme be?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
You are welcome to comment here, but if you have a strong opinion on this topic, the best way to express it is <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com">by creating, following, or commiting to an Area 51 proposal</a>.</p>
<p>
While we love expert communities -- they are quite literally the fabric of Stack Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User -- we don't want our shared mustard obsession to come between us.</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p>

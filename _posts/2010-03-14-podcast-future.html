<p>Hey presto! Jeff gave me permission to publish here, so from now on, you'll be seeing posts from both of us.</p>
<p>The first thing I want to talk about is plans for the podcast. I feel like the current podcast format needs to be freshened up a little bit. I think we've started repeating ourselves quite a bit. As a part of my <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2010/03/14.html">retirement</a> from blogging, I'm trying to stop personal public pontification, podcast or otherwise.</p>
<p>Add your ideas in the comments for what you'd like the new podcast to be like. Here are some of my thoughts to start you off:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less about programming and programmers, and more about the broader world of Stack Overflow, Server Fault, Super User, and Stack Exchange.</li>
<li>Either Jeff starts laughing at my jokes, or else we get one of those radio morning zoo people like Robin Quivers who laughs at everything.</li>
<li>More interesting guests and people from the community; less monologues by me about why the earth is banana-shaped.</li>
</ul>
<p>After this week's episode we'll officially kill the current podcast and go quiet for a couple of weeks. We'll launch the new format in early April when the StackOverflow team visits New York.</p>

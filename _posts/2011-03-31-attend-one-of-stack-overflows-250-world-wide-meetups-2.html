<p>If you haven't heard by now, <a title="Stack Overflow MeetUps – April 6" href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/stack-overflow-meetups-april-6/">April 6 is World-Wide Stack Overflow MeetUp Day</a>!  Wondering what the purpose of this MeetUp is?  Our developer <a title="balpha" href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/115866/balpha">Ben</a> put it best:  "The way I see it is that it's an opportunity to meet some of those 32x32 avatars in real life.  Have a snack, have a drink, talk geek stuff, that kind of thing.  Of course if you create a real event with speakers &amp; such, that's awesome -- but it's about having fun as well."</p>

<p>Some communities have already organized some pretty cool MeetUps!</p>
<ul>
<li>Petrioli Gabriele, a member of the <a title="Athens, Greece MeetUp" href="http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/athens-gr/83942">Athens, Greece MeetUp</a> created a query to target the <a title="Top 100 Greek Stack Overflow users" href="http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/qe/1157/top-100-users-from-greece">top 100 Greek Stack Overflow users</a> to attend.</li>
<li>Chad La Guardia is organizing a MeetUp group for Austinites and University of Texas students at <a title="UT Austin MeetUp" href="http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/university-of-texas/84026">UT's Austin Campus</a> to mingle and network.  Hook 'em Horns!</li>
<li>Not sure of what to do in your community?  Check out our custom MeetUp <a title="Chat Room" href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/632/worldwide-meetup-day">chat room</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With only a few days left until World-Wide Stack Overflow MeetUp Day (April 6!), it is important to secure a venue and encourage others to attend.  The MeetUp folks were impressed at your commitment, and now's the time to make it count.  We've also got bragging rights at stake; MeetUp keeps track of the <a title="MeetUp Everywhere" href="http://www.meetup.com/everywhere/">largest events</a> to date, see any group you'd like to beat?</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions about how you can spread the word:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the hashtag #SOMeetup on Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube when posting about Stack Overflow MeetUps</li>
<li>Post a link to your local MeetUp page on Facebook and Twitter, email the page to your friends, promote in blog posts, etc.</li>
<li>Use the custom Stack Overflow MeetUp <a title="MeetUp Widgets" href="http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/widgets">widgets</a></li>
<li>Invite a friend or two to come with you</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to bring business cards so you can network at the event and take lots of pictures! We want to see them posted on Twitter and Flickr (#SOMeetup) afterwards!</p>
<p>See you April 6!</p>
<p><small><small>P.S.  We've gotten a lot of questions regarding companies sponsoring the MeetUps.  Our stance is that a company donating space/food/drink for the event is fine, but that using the event as an avenue for marketing or as a captive audience opportunity to profit is not ok.  At the end of the day, this is about the community gathering together and having fun!</small></small></p>

<p>I'm pleased to announce that we're kicking off 2011 with even more new blood on the team, including <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/181481/rebecca-chernoff">Rebecca Chernoff</a>.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rebecca-chernoff-pic.jpg" alt="" title="rebecca-chernoff-pic" width="396" height="393" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6570" /></p>
<p>Rebecca will be working remotely for us from Missouri, in a hybrid role of technical evangelist and community coordinator.</p>
<p>If you've spent any time at all on our network -- and in particular on our (<i>excellent, amazing, best-in-class</i>, choose your superlatives, they all apply) <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/stack-overflow-chat-now-live/">web chat system</a> -- you've probably run into Rebecca and her unusual backwards smileys at some point. In addition to being one of our very first <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/">pro-tem moderators</a> for <a href="http://webapps.stackexchange.com">Webapps</a>, she is apparently everywhere! In fact, when we took informal polls of who from the community we should hire as another community coordinator, <b>she was almost universally at the top of everyone's list</b>, including our own list. Yes, she is that cool.</p>
<p>In addition to writing a whole bunch of <a href="http://github.com/rchern/StackExchangeScripts">useful userscripts</a> for Stack Exchange sites and chat, Rebecca also worked extensively with the <a href="http://stackapps.com/">Stack Exchange API</a> to build <a href="http://stackflair.com/">StackFlair</a>.</p>

<p>Rebecca's role is somewhat unique within the company, in that she will work with <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00005/">Robert Cartaino</a> as a supporting Community Coordinator, and also with the core team in a Technical Evangelist role. That is, she will assist in supporting our API and making sure the overall experience on our sites -- whether through the API or as an end user -- is as polished and smooth as possible.</p>
<p>Since we have 35+ sites now, and 130+ community moderators, we can sure use the help. Welcome to the team, Rebecca! (:</p>

Are you familiar with the way <a href="http://craigslist.org">craigslist</a> handles <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/help/flags_and_community_moderation">post flagging</a>?</p>
<p>

<p>
Based on recent feedback, we're <b>enhancing Stack Overflow's flagging support</b> to bring it more in line with that well established model.</p>
<p>

<p>
We belatedly realized that asking users to email us to report content problems on the site* was not exactly efficient. Now you can flag something that needs moderator attention with three clicks (and a little typing).</p>
<p>
Some rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>You still need 15 reputation to flag anything at all.
</li>
<li>Each user gets a limited number of flags per day (5 offensive, 5 spam, and 10 inform moderator).
</li>
<li>These flags age. After two days, they automatically dissipate harmlessly and without effect from the system.
</li>
<li>If an individual post reaches a threshold of six offensive or spam votes within two days, it will be automatically deleted from the system by the Community user.
</li>
<li>You cannot flag the same post multiple times.
</li>
<li>Flag counts are no longer shown to anyone except moderators.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This is more or less directly based on discussion around previous blog entries <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/in-defense-of-editing/">In Defense of Editing</a> and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/a-day-in-the-penalty-box/">A Day in the Penalty Box</a>. I closed the related <a href="http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/pages/general/suggestions/159703-allow-for-reporting-of-content-and-users-to-mods-and-or-team">UserVoice ticket</a> as completed.</p>
<p>
And yes, a similar style of flagging (but more lightweight) is coming very soon for comments.</p>

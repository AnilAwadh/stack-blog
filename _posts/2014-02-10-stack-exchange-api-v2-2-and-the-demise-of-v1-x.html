<p>There's been a lot of excitement lately here at Stack Exchange, what with the launch of our <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/2014/01/stack-exchange-for-android-is-here/">Android app</a> and the start of our <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/220264/help-us-test-the-alpha-version-of-our-ios-app">iOS app alpha</a>.  A few sharp-eyed users noticed, hidden deep within each app, a new version of the Stack Exchange API. After a few more weeks of testing I'm happy to say that<strong> V2.2 is now frozen, <a href="http://api.stackexchange.com/docs/">documented</a>, and released</strong>.</p>
<h2>What's<a href="http://api.stackexchange.com/docs/change-log"> new in this release</a>?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Creating questions and answers</li>
<li>Voting</li>
<li>Editing, Deleting, and Flagging</li>
<li>Improved OAuth UI on mobile devices</li>
<li>…and lots more</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost everything done by our own apps is using our public API, but there are a few notable exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don't think the Feed is polished enough for inclusion yet</li>
<li>User creation is too sensitive to guarantee stability</li>
<li>Login methods that don't use OAuth can't be made public for security reasons</li>
</ul>
<p>With the <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/2012/02/stack-exchange-api-v2-0-no-longer-beta/">third</a> <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/2012/09/stack-exchange-api-v2-1/">release</a> of the API V2.x family, we've decided to retire the V1.x family at long last.  Version 1.0 of the Stack Exchange API was <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/2010/07/stack-exchange-api-1-0-imminent/">released i<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">n 2010</span></a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">, with its last update (V1.1) </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/2011/02/stack-exchange-api-1-1-and-improved-app-gallery/">almost exactly three years ago</a>, and its ultimate <a href="http://stackapps.com/questions/3439/deprecating-api-v1-x">deprecation in 2012</a>. Active consumers were notified of its imminent demise earlier this year, but this is the public announcement:</p>
<h2>V1.0 and V1.1 of the Stack Exchange API will be shut down <span style="text-decoration: underline;">May 12th</span></h2>
<p>I encourage anyone still using the V1.x family to use the coming months to migrate to V2.2. It's much improved.</p>

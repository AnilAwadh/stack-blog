<p class="alignright" style="margin-left:1.5em"><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/T59Q82L"><img src="assets/1efaea9356764cb6a86564960eba62bb.png" /></a></p>
<p>It's that most wonderful time of the year again -- time for <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/T59Q82L">the Stack Overflow Annual Survey</a>! So, put down that third glass of eggnog and fire up a new tab. It only takes a few minutes - and there are stickers!</p>
<p>As the name suggests, we've been doing this for a few years now (here are the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/survey-says/">2010 results</a> and the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/02/survey-results/">2011 results</a> for your perusal) and we always learn a lot from them. This data is used to support the advertising we sell on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="http://serverfault.com">Server Fault</a>. Advertising helps keep the lights on (and servers humming) around here, so if you use either (or both!) sites, we urge you to participate. </p>
<p>For those of you who've been around this block with us before, the survey should look fairly familiar. There's no longer <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/158456/stack-overflow-annual-user-survey/158471#158471">two jQuery options</a>, though you can still jQuery while you jQuery if you need to. There are some questions that are a bit different, so please read each item carefully before you respond.</p>
<p>Just like previous years, we're putting ads like the one above around the site to solicit particpation, and this blog post will help us reach our goal of roughly 3,500 responses. We'll share the results of the survey with you all in a blog post early next year, and you'll have the option of signing up to receive a copy of the results emailed to you directly at the end of the survey. So, please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/T59Q82L">take a few moments to fill out the survey</a> and then you can get right back to <a href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m04t4pkRg91rq9ex7o1_250.gif">your holiday festivities</a>.</p>

If you'd like to help us beta test Stack Overflow, in advance of the Monday launch, here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://beta.stackoverflow.com">beta.stackoverflow.com</a>
</li>
<li>Enter "twitter@twitter.com" and "falkensmaze" to gain access (note that <i>this is NOT an account</i>: it's merely a password to gain access to the beta)
</li>
<li>Please do bear in mind <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/07/stack-overflow-private-beta-begins/">the beta test guidelines</a>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
When asking questions, try to keep them on topic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your question about <b>programming</b>?
</li>
<li>We prefer questions that can be <i>answered</i>, not just discussed.
</li>
<li>Provide details, but write clearly and simply.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I thought these guidelines were straightforward, but they haven't stopped anyone from asking anything they damn well please. Every time I visit the site, I half expect to see "How do I make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?"</p>
<p>
If you're wondering what's so special about Stack Overflow, the answer is -- well, nothing, really. It's a programming Q&A website. The only unusual thing we do is synthesize aspects of Wikis, Blogs, Forums, and Digg/Reddit in a way that is somewhat original. Or at least we think so.</p>
<p>

<p>
Stack Overflow is that tiny asterisk in the middle, there.</p>
<p>
But hopefully you'll see what I mean when you experience it for yourself.</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p>

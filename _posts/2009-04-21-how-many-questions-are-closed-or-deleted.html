Based on the discussion about <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/the-stack-overflow-question-lifecycle/">The Stack Overflow Question Lifecycle</a>, which I'd characterize very broadly this way...</p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/10/a-question-about-questions/">Programming Related</a> Queston &rarr; Answers!</p>
<p>
<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/10/a-question-about-questions/">Non-Programming Related</a> Question &rarr; Closed &rarr; Deleted (eventually, depending)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
... I thought it would be a good idea to couch the discussion in terms of actual <i>data</i>. Here's a breakdown of all the Stack Overflow questions and answers to date:</p>
<table width="400" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="right" />
<td align="right">Closed</td>
<td align="right">Deleted</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Questions</td>
<td align="right">150,433</td>
<td align="right"><font color="#555">5,900</font></td>
<td align="right"><font color="red">9,794</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Answers</td>
<td align="right">625,734</td>
<td align="right"><font color="#555">n/a</font></td>
<td align="right"><font color="red">55,765</font></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The number of closed questions is not quite 4% of all questions ever asked. </p>
<p>
Remember that we do not require any form of registration; we allow totally anonymous users to ask whatever they want. Even a <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/adventures-in-delclusionism/">hard-line inclusionist</a> would agree that <b><u>half</u> of those closed questions <i>should</i> have been closed</b> as obviously not programming related, spam, or garbage. (Also, if you are a dogmatist who thinks no Stack Overflow question should <i>ever</i> be closed for <i>any</i> reason, Stack Overflow is probably not the right website for you.)</p>
<p>
So that means when we cast close and open votes on a question, we are disagreeing about <b>one question in every fifty</b>.</p>
<p /></p></p></p>

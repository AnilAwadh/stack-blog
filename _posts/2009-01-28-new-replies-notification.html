<p>
We just rolled out a new replies notification feature. You'll notice that there is a small envelope icon next to your name at the top of the page.</p>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/recent-activity-alert-off.png" alt="recent-activity-alert-off" title="recent-activity-alert-off" style="border: 1px silver solid;" /></p>
<p>
Every 30 minutes, we check to see if <b>new comments</b> have been added to your posts, or if <b>new answers</b> have been added to your questions. If so, the envelope will light up. Mousing over the envelope will explain what's going on.</p>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/recent-activity-alert-on.png" alt="recent-activity-alert-on" title="recent-activity-alert-on" style="border: 1px silver solid;" /></p>
<p>
Clicking on the envelope in either state will take you to your <b>recent activity page</b>. This page is private to you.</p>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/recent-activity-page.png" alt="recent-activity-page" title="recent-activity-page" style="border:1px solid silver;" /></p>
<p>
The focus of the recent activity page is <b>things other Stack Overflow users have done to your stuff!</b> In other words, if users have...</p>
<ul>
<li>added answers to your questions
</li>
<li>commented on your questions or answers
</li>
<li>edited your posts
</li>
<li>voted your content up or down (or otherwise) affecting your reputation
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It's visible here.</p>
<p>
We also have a handy topbar notification if you've been away from Stack Overflow for <b>at least 24 hours</b>. It links to the exact same page, but will tell you exactly how many new answers and comments your posts have generated while you were gone.</p>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/replies-topbar-alert.png" alt="replies-topbar-alert" title="replies-topbar-alert" style="border: 1px silver solid;" /></p>
<p>
We're still refining how the recent activity page works, but hopefully this will make it <b>easier for you to find (and possibly respond) to the answers and comments left on your posts!</b></p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p></p>

<p>Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast #43 with Joel Spolsky, Jay Hanlon, David Fullerton, and special guest <a href="http://alexisohanian.com/" target="_blank">Alexis Ohanian</a>, calling in from the <a href="http://www.tutorspree.com/" target="_blank">Tutorspree</a> office. Alexis is the co-founder of <a href="http://reddit.com/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and an investor in <a href="http://hipmunk.com/" target="_blank">Hipmunk</a>. He's a strong advocate against SOPA and PIPA, and knows how to dress well while doing so, thanks to Joel. (Listen on to figure out what we're talking about here.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Talking about subreddits: Alexis wanted tags to categorize content coming into Reddit, but his co-founder <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/spez" target="_blank">Steve Huffman</a> pushed for subreddits. Alexis tells us why and how it works as well as it does. (Joel has <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/joel" target="_blank">his own subreddit!</a> And it was the first one ever!)</li>
<li>Alexis has a book coming out in the fall called <i>Without Their Permission</i>. "Their" refers to gatekeepers - people who stand between people and access to information. He also has <a href="http://www.hyperink.com/Make-Something-People-Love-Lessons-From-A-Startup-Guy-b1478">another book</a> already out.</li>
<li>So what's the next annoying thing that Washington is going to do to stymy innovation? The <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp" target="_blank">Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement</a> is on the horizon. We dive into the wonderful world of software patent law.</li>
<li>Per Joel: Amazon's 1-Click is the only thing that should have a patent. Nothing else needs one.</li>
<li>Let's move on to copyright! Or get distracted and continue talking about patents! Just kidding, we successfully moved on to copyright (and how it relates to wishing someone a joyful anniversary of their birth).</li>
<li>We also decided that Creative Commons needs to come up with a better open source birthday song. (Also, copyright should not be granted to anything Jay doesn't like.)</li>
<li>Moving on: Kickstarter and friends. The connected web is changing the way people make things and sell them to other people who want to experience them. (Alexis Ohanian's project <a href="http://breadpig.com/" target="_blank">Breadpig</a> is one of the companies leading the charge in this area.)</li>
<li>Back to Reddit. Alexis walks us through the way Reddit works as a communication platform, and how the team handles "unwanted", but legal, speech (spoiler alert: they try to avoid censorship). Sometimes you find yourself in the tough position of having to defend reperehensible, but legal, ideas. Sometimes, though, <a href="http://jezebel.com/5946643/reddit-users-attempt-to-shame-sikh-woman-get-righteously-schooled" target="_blank">someone can learn something</a>.</li>
<li>Oh, and finally: Alexis was supposed to eat a spoonful of cinnamon on the podcast today. New rule for podcast guests! Alexis says it's impossible, but he's discovered that he does indeed have some cinnamon accessible to him…</li>
</ul>
<p>See you next week!</p>

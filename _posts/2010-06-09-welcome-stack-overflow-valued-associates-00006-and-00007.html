I'm pleased to announce that Stack Overflow Inc has added two more valued associates to our team:</p>
<p><h2>#00006 <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/23354/marc-gravell">Marc Gravell</a>, United Kingdom</h2>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bio-marc-gravell.jpg" alt="" title="bio-marc-gravell" width="271" height="272" /></p>
<p>
<a href="http://marcgravell.blogspot.com/">Marc</a> is a long time elected community moderator, C# MVP, and the #2 user on Stack Overflow, as sorted by reputation. Just under some guy I've never heard of.</p>
<p><h2>#00007 <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/115866/balpha">Ben Dumke</a>, Germany</h2>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bio-ben-dumke.jpg" alt="" title="bio-ben-dumke" width="271" height="295" /></p>
<p>
Ben is the perpetrator of the gloriously wonderful Unicornify (see <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/03/reminder-its-april-1st/">April 1 2010</a>), <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/21600">HREF overflow</a>, the <a href="http://notarealquestion.appspot.com/">not a real question</a> game -- as well as dozens of prescient meta suggestions and bugfixes.</p>
<p>
You've probably noticed by now that neither Ben nor Marc live in the United States. The <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/where-in-the-world-do-stack-overflow-users-come-from/">last time I checked</a>, only <b>36%</b> of Stack Overflow's traffic was from the USA. Where exactly do you think that other <b>64%</b> of our traffic comes from?</p>
<p>
As I <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/05/on-working-remotely.html">alluded to in a recent blog post</a>, the way we build the Stack Exchange network should be genuinely reflective of what it <i>already is</i> -- <b>websites with avid international users all over the globe</b>. That's why I'm so proud to have a truly international development team at last, built by <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/eating-our-own-careers-dogfood/">dogfooding</a> from the amazing worldwide community that has grown up around our websites.</p>
<p>
Welcome Marc and Ben. It's an honor to serve with you in this <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/06/the-vast-and-endless-sea.html">vast and endless sea</a>.</p>
<p>
(Oh, and keep your eyes open, because we aren't quite done adding team members yet.)</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p>

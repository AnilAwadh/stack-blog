<p>The entire extended Stack Overflow team (including the Stack Exchange team) is meeting in New York in April to do some strategic planning. For example, we need to plan our Rock Band song lists, decide who gets to be on the drums and who is stuck with the USB cowbell, etc.</p>
<p>If you're going to be in the city on Tuesday, April 6th, we'd like to invite you to join us for a party and a chance to meet the team.</p>
<p>If you want to come to the party, you <strong>must</strong> <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dFJVYTV2RWV5VUtvRjg5Q1VleEd2T0E6MA">register</a>. Please do not register if you're not sure that you're coming, as space is limited. Only people who are on <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dFJVYTV2RWV5VUtvRjg5Q1VleEd2T0E6MA">the list</a> will be admitted.</p>
<p><font color="red">Update</font>: Pictures from the Open House are <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/liz.gordon/StackOverflowOpenHouse4610?authkey=Gv1sRgCNfrsfaKkvzxhgE">now available!</a> Thanks to everyone who attended!</p>

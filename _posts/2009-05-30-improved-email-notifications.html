<p>
In addition to our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/02/now-showing-email-notifications/">previous email support</a>, we now offer question owners the ability to <b>receive email notifications of new answers to individual questions.</b></p>
<p>
It's a new option at the bottom of any question you've asked:</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/stackoveflow-question-email-ui.png" alt="stackoveflow-question-email-ui" title="stackoveflow-question-email-ui" style="border:1px solid silver" /></p>
<p>
Ticking this box will enable global email notifications in your account preferences, and entering an email address here is <i>exactly</i> the same as updating it in your profile. (This will soon be extended to the /ask page so you can opt-in at the time of asking, too.)</p>
<p>
Once checked, you will get a <b>single daily summary email</b> of answers to all questions where you've checked this box. You don't even have to visit Stack Overflow to get answers -- as long as you're willing to wait until midnight GMT when the daily rollup email notifications are sent out.</p>
<p>
And don't worry -- as with every email we send, there is a one-click global unsubscribe if you don't want to get any more emails from us.</p>
<p /></p></p></p>

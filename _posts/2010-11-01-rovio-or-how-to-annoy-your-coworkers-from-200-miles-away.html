<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/11/dont-forget-to-lock-your-computer.html">annoying my coworkers</a>. Problem is, I don't have any coworkers because <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/05/on-working-remotely.html">I work remotely from home</a>. An impossible conundrum. <i>Or is it?</i></p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001CQLGD6/?tag=stackoverfl08-20">Rovio, the wi-fi enabled robotic WebCam</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001CQLGD6/?tag=stackoverfl08-20"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rovio.jpg" alt="" title="rovio" width="332" height="308" /></a></p>
<p>Rovio got mixed reviews, but we decided to give it a shot anyway. You control Rovio through a web browser interface, with full (but low-res) video and audio. Here's a few shots of us driving around the New York World Headquarters.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rovio-ui-1.jpg" alt="" title="rovio-ui-1" width="600" height="355" /></p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rovio-ui-2.jpg" alt="" title="rovio-ui-2" width="600" height="355" /></p>
<p>Like explorers from the old world, we created maps of the New York office as we discovered it. Rovio is surprisingly full featured for an inexpensive little 'bot:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can auto-dock with its base station when you get close enough -- so you can drive around for quite a while, so long as you remember to return to the dock before the batteries die.
</li>
<li>There's a little LED for night lighting. It's not very effective, but ... it exists.
</li>
<li>There are three camera positions: low, medium, and high.
</li>
<li>It can move more or less in a circle from a standing position, so it doesn't get stuck <i>too</i> much.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, you might even say some of us ... got a little obsessed with it. Behold the Rovio Maze Of Doom<sup>tm</sup> created by David Fullerton, George Beech, and Jason Punyon:</p>

<p>Is that Zardoz, as featured on <a href="http://stackapps.com/404">the 404 page of Stack Apps</a> we see in the maze? They don't call it the Maze of Doom<sup>tm</sup> for nothing, man!</p>
<p>Ben Dumke also hooked Rovio up to our internal chat, so you can call out his/her/its name and see what it's up to.</p>

<p>All in all, we've really enjoyed Rovio. If you, too, need to annoy your coworkers from 2,800+ miles away -- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001CQLGD6/?tag=stackoverfl08-20">we highly recommend it</a>.</p>

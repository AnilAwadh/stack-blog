<p>The FAQ has contained <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/faq#questions">one key bit of advice</a> from the very beginning:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It’s also perfectly fine to ask and answer your own question, as long as you pretend you’re on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!"><em>Jeopardy!</em></a> -- phrase it in the form of a question.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>So &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a question that you already know the answer to</li>
<li>if you'd like to document it in public so others (including yourself) can find it later</li>
<li>it is OK to ask, and answer, your own question on a relevant <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">Stack Exchange site</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be crystal clear, <b>it is not merely OK to ask and answer your own question, it is <i>explicitly encouraged</i></b>.</p>
<p>I do it all the time! For example, when I ran into a nasty issue with Java exploits in Google Chrome when browsing for images, I <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/201613/disable-java-plugin-in-google-chrome">documented that on Super User by asking and answering my own question</a>. Now, others can benefit from my misfortune -- and best of all, I got new even better answers beyond what I offered! Overall, a huge win all around.</p>
<p>Friend of the company Dana Robinson recently wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  On a project I'm working on at my current job, I've come across some really pernicious problems where there is either</p>
<ul>
<li>no good information available or </li>
<li>the good information is buried under a sea of bad information.  </li>
</ul>
<p>  I've kept these issues in the back of my head and, now that that part of the project is winding down and the issues are resolved, I plan to go on Stack Overflow and create a high-value question and answer pair for each issue.  That way, the next person who has the problem won't have to slog through so much misinformation.  I might even learn some more about the various issues that plagued us if other experts chime in with their own knowledge.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Bottom line -- <b>never hesitate to ask and answer your own question on any Stack Exchange site.</b> Please do! It's all part of our shared mission to make the internet better.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Emmett <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/87239/suggest-the-next-feature-for-the-stackexchange-com-master-website">asked for feedback</a> on what we should improve next on <a href="http://stackexchange.com">stackexchange.com</a>.</p>
<p>The consensus seemed to be that the existing functionality was good, but it could be simpler to use -- as expressed by Pekka:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I miss the carefully crafted minimalism that I've come to love so much on SO. From that perspective, stackexchange.com is not yet doing as well as I would expect from what is the public face of the network, and its official headquarters. I don't have a clear idea of what needs to be done, but I would like to see the site taking a more intuitive and beginner-friendly approach to exploring the network.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Nowhere is this more apparent than Tag Sets, which <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/tag-sets-on-stack-exchange/">we originally rolled out last November</a>. Tag sets are actually an <i>incredibly</i> powerful feature, but the UI for it ... uh, not so good. </p>
<p>We rolled up our sleeves and built an all new, <i>much</i> friendlier interface. We also renamed it to something that's hopefully a bit clearer: <b>filters</b>.</p>
<p><a href="http://stackexchange.com/filters"><img src="assets/stack-exchange-tag-filters.png" alt="" title="stack-exchange-tag-filters" width="600" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>There are also two new built-in, default filters available for every network user:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>My Sites</b> -- all questions on every site that you have an account on
</li>
<li><b>Favorite Tags</b> -- all questions on every site in the favorite tags you've selected on those sites
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://stackexchange.com/filters">Filters</a> (n√©e Tag Sets) are a perfect way to follow activity on tags across the whole Stack Exchange <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">network</a>, either in the browser or via email subscriptions. If you tried it before and were flummoxed by the UI, <b><a href="http://stackexchange.com/filters">please do give it another shot and let us know what you think.</a></b></p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/04/stack-exchange-network-profiles/">you have a network profile</a> at stackexchange.com, too.</p>

<p>Expect more news on this soon!</p>

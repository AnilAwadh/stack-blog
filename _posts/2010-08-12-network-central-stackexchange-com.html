I'm proud to announce that <a href="http://stackexchange.com">stackexchange.com</a> is now <b>the official network hub for the entire Stack Exchange 2.0 network!</b></p>
<p>
<a href="http://stackexchange.com"><img src="assets/stackexchange-new-homepage.png" alt="" title="stackexchange-new-homepage" width="600" height="388" style="border:1px solid silver" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>
Thanks to the herculean contributions of team members <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/91687/david-fullerton">David Fullerton</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2749/emmett-nicholas">Emmett Nicholas</a>, our shiny new network hub contains:</p>
<ol>
<li>A list of the <b><a href="http://stackexchange.com">most interesting questions <i>right now</i></a></b>, across the entire Stack Exchange network
</li>
<li>A directory, with statistics and rankings, of <b><a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">all public sites in the Stack Exchange network</a></b>
</li>
<li>A <b><a href="http://stackexchange.com/leagues">per-site user reputation league</a></b> for all Stack Exchange websites
</li>
</ol>
<p>
But how do you know you're on a Stack Exchange 2.0 network website?</p>
<p>
Why, I'm glad you asked!</p>
<p>
Just check for <b>the genuine<sup>tm</sup> Stack Exchange logo in the upper left hand corner</b>. If you see that, you can be sure it's the real deal, and not some brand-x knockoff site. Better yet ... <i>click it!</i></p>
<p>

<p>
<img src="assets/genuwine-stack-exchange-sites.png" alt="" title="genuwine-stack-exchange-sites" width="420" height="350" style="border:1px solid silver" /></p>
<p>
That's right, stackexchange.com is now <i>so awesome</i> that <b>every one of our sites carries a wee mini pocket version of it along with them</b>, like a kangaroo with a joey in its pouch.</p>
<p>
And that's not all. We've also rolled out something that's been requested for a very long time: <b>Reputation Leagues</b>.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://stackexchange.com/leagues"><img src="assets/reputation-league-weekly.png" alt="" title="reputation-league-weekly" width="600" height="468" style="border: 1px solid silver" /></a></p>
<p>
For any Stack Exchange website, you can see <b>monthly, weekly, and quarterly reputation league user rankings</b>, along with velocity (change per time interval). This strictly a <i>for fun</i> feature -- it's meant as a friendly, informal way of tracking your reputation on a particular Stack Exchange site. (Not that these reputation leagues won't inevitably become a bloodthirsty fight to the death, but hey -- I tried. It really is just for fun and stats junkies!)</p>
<p>
I'm proud to finally have a network anchor site worthy of the name. We're still in the process of adding many more features, performance tweaks, and bugfixes to <a href="http://stackexchange.com">stackexchange.com</a>, but it's a promising start, and a major milestone toward our overall Stack Exchange 2.0 network vision.</p>
<p>
Enjoy!</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>

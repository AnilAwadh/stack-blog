<p>When we <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/09/apptivate-ms-a-windows-8-app-development-contest/">announced the Apptivate.MS competition</a> two months ago, we were hoping that a few members of this community would create and submit a few solid Windows 8 apps - forty or fifty, maybe. A hundred if it <em>really</em> went well.</p>
<p>So when we saw all of the high-quality and innovative app submissions that poured in, we were quite frankly blown away. The Stack Overflow community submitted <strong>almost 400 apps</strong>. <a href="http://apptivate.ms/apps">See for yourself</a>!</p>
<div class="wp-caption"><img style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="assets/zw2JG.png" alt="" width="460px;" height="276px;" title="Apps are the REAL real thing" />
<p class="wp-caption-text">Yet again, the Stack Overflow community has <em>crushed it</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>The quality and size of the submission pool made our next job really, really difficult: narrowing them down to just 50 apps for the semi-finals, ten for each of the following category groups: <a href="http://apptivate.ms/apps/groups/1/knowledge">Knowledge</a>, <a href="http://apptivate.ms/apps/groups/2/games">Games</a>, <a href="http://apptivate.ms/apps/groups/3/interest">Interest</a>, <a href="http://apptivate.ms/apps/groups/4/work">Work</a>, and <a href="http://apptivate.ms/apps/groups/5/social">Social</a>. A panel of Stack Exchange judges (appointed by Microsoft) ranked all the submissions based on the following rubric:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Innovativeness/Creativity (30%)</li>
<li dir="ltr">Quality of Submission (30%)</li>
<li dir="ltr">Use of Windows 8 features, such as the live tile display (30%)</li>
<li dir="ltr">Public Appeal (voting) (10%)</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>With these criteria in mind, we put together <a href="http://apptivate.ms/semi-finals">a killer semi-finalist slate</a>. You can vote for your three favorite apps in each category group between now and December 16th (23:59 UTC).</p>
<p>The three highest-voted apps in each category group <a href="http://apptivate.ms/contest#developer-contest">will win prizes</a> no matter what. They'll also be eligible for a $5000 cash grand prize, so cast your votes to ensure that the best app wins the day. Not an altruist? Voting in the semi-finals also makes you eligible for the <a href="http://apptivate.ms/contest#reviewer-contest">reviewer contest</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">The three top-voted semi-finalists in each category group will win great prizes!</p>
</div>
<p>You can also continue to leave comments on any app, which also gets you entry into the reviewer contest - as well as providing valuable feedback to Windows 8 developers.</p>
<p>The semi-finals voting phase ends December 16th, 2012, so get your votes in now!</p>

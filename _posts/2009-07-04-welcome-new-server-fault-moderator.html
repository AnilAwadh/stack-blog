Last week, the first user <a href="http://serverfault.com/users">reached 10,000 reputation on Server Fault</a>.</p>
<p>
That user is <a href="http://serverfault.com/users/45/splattne">splattne</a>.</p>
<p>
<iframe src="http://serverfault.com/users/flair/45.html" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="210px" height="60px"></iframe></p>
<p>
I had already noticed Stefan from his high quality contributions to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/6461/splattne">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/splattne">Twitter</a>, where he seems like a genuinely nice guy and a true geek like us. So when he passed the magical 10k mark, I felt comfortable emailing him to ask if he'd be interested in becoming a Server Fault community moderator. Luckily for us, he was!</p>
<p>
(One other benefit of Stefan as a moderator is that he lives in Italy. A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_F3YWYFIyA">really beautiful part of it</a>, apparently. This gives us better time coverage for the current SF moderators who are mostly US-based.)</p>
<p>
Anyway, <b>welcome to splattne</b>, our newest member of the growing family of community moderators!</p>
<p>
If you're ever curious who the moderators are for a given site, they are all listed on the /about page for each one. The <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/about">about page for the meta site</a> is probably the best single place to look, since all moderators across our sites are <i>also</i> moderators there.</p>

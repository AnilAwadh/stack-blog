Geoff "the malice from corvallis" Dalgas has done it again. Over the last week he was busy implementing <a href="http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/pages/general/suggestions/17937">the number one UserVoice request</a> -- tag preferences for a customized Stack Overflow homepage.</p>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/stackoverflow-ignored-interesting.png" alt="stackoverflow-ignored-interesting" title="stackoverflow-ignored-interesting" width="264" /></p>
<p>
You'll notice there are two places you can now enter your <b>ignored tags</b> and <b>interesting tags</b>.</p>
<ol>
<li>On most question pages, in the right sidebar
</li>
<li>On your users page, under the "Preferences" tab
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Once you've enter some tag preferences, the questions appear differently depending on whether they contain a tag in your list.</p>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/stackoverflow-ignored-interesting-questions.png" alt="stackoverflow-ignored-interesting-questions" title="stackoverflow-ignored-interesting-questions" width="600" /></p>
<p>
<i>Interesting</i> questions are highlighted; <i>ignored</i> questions are dimmed.</p>
<p>
We planning to enhance and build out the tag preferences feature a bit more, but even as-is it should hopefully help you distinguish what you like from what you don't like a bit better. Note that we also increased the number of questions that show up on the homepage by default, all the better to filter your "ignore" and "interesting" against.</p>
<p>
Also, a tip of the hat to <a href="http://insin.webfactional.com/">Jonathan Buchanan's</a> most excellent <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/34366">Stack Overflow Tag Manager</a> script, which was the inspiration for this feature. I'm sure Jonathan's add-in will continue to evolve cool new features faster than our website can, so I encourage you to check it out.</p>
<p>
In fact, there's <a href="http://stackapps.com">quite an ecosystem of third party tools for Stack Overflow</a>. If there are any third party tools or add-ons you feel are absolutely <i>essential</i>, let us know on UserVoice, and we'll try to roll those features into the core website so every Stack Overflow user can benefit.</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p>

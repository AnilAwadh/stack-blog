<p>We're <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/08/stack-exchange-now-60-valued-associates-strong/">growing</a> like crazy! Between launching exciting new sites, developing new features and promotions for existing ones, and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/08/stack-exchange-takes-on-denver-welcome-to-our-new-colleagues/">branching out geographically</a>, Stack Exchange can use all the help it can get - so we’re currently hiring for seven (7!) different positions, from developers to designers to sales to... well, just look at the list yourself:</p>

<li><a href="http://stackexchange.com/about/hiring/sales-representative-inside-sales-careers-2.0">Sales Representative – Inside Sales – Careers 2.0</a> (Denver, New York)</li>
</ul>
<p>We're <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/eating-our-own-careers-dogfood/">dogfooding</a> Careers for these of course, since who better to help make the software running Stack Exchange more awesome than the folks <em>using</em> Stack Exchange. Here are a few positions that are especially appropriate to our community:</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/23227/stack-exchange-product-manager-stack-exchange">Product Manager - Q&amp;A Team</a> (telecommute or New York)</h2>
<p>We’re looking for someone to help us design and build the next set of features and special projects for Stack Exchange.  We want someone with serious startup experience building and shipping products, from conception to deployment.  You’ll take ideas from us and the community, or come up with your own, and work with our designers and developers to get them shipped.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/23229/stack-exchange-developer-telecommute-stack-exchange">Web Developer - Q&amp;A Team</a> (telecommute or New York)</h2>
<p>We’re looking for a top-notch web developer for the Core Q&amp;A team.  You’ll work directly on the engine that powers all the sites to ship new features, fix bugs, and scale and grow the sites.  We want someone with serious front-to-back web development experience (C# not required), a track record of getting stuff done, and a history of activity in the community.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/16279/stack-overflow-careers-developer-new-york-stack-exchange">Web Developer - Careers Team</a> (New York)</h2>
<p>We’re looking for more top-notch web developers to work on building Careers into the best place for developers to find a job, anywhere.  You’ll work on lots of new features, fix bugs, and help us decide the future of Careers.  We want someone with serious front-to-back web development experience (C# not required), a track record of getting stuff done, and a history of activity in the community.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/24001/senior-systems-administrator-stack-exchange">Senior Systems Administrator</a> (telecommute or New York)</h2>
<p>We’re looking for a veteran Windows / Linux systems administrator to join our team.  You’ll help build out our infrastructure and keep it ahead of the growth curve.  We want someone with experience working with both Windows and Linux systems (emphasis on Windows), and a track record of taking on big challenges and delivering <a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/">blog-worthy</a> solutions.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/24481/product-designer-stack-exchange">Product Designer</a> (telecommute or New York)</h2>
<p>Last, but not least, we need a product designer.  You’ll work with <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/21721/jin">Jin</a> to help our developers and product managers design new features, create and implement full brand identities for new Stack Exchange sites, and help improve user experience across the network.  We want someone with a portfolio of web design and experience working directly with developers and product managers to design products and features.</p>
<h2>Telecommute?</h2>
<p>Most of these positions are open to the world: we want to hire the best people, wherever they are.  However, there are a few things you should be aware of:</p>
<ol>
<li>You should be awesome at working remotely -- self-motivated and aggressively communicative -- to make sure you stay on the same page as the rest of your team</li>
<li>We still believe in getting teams together at least once a week to talk, and that generally happens between 1 - 5pm EDT.  You’ll need to be flexible with your hours</li>
<li>There may be some countries that are legally too difficult for us to work with...sorry!</li>
</ol>
<p>A few positions are in-office only, <em>but don’t worry: we have awesome offices</em>.  In fact, a few people who started working remotely moved to New York just to get access to our catered lunches.  If you do want to move to New York (or our sales offices in Denver or London), we’ll assist you with relocation but you must already have the permanent right to work in the country of the office (US or UK).</p>
<h1>Apply!</h1>
<p>Each job has instructions to apply, and we're hiring immediately.  If you see a job that might be a fit for you or someone you know, apply soon.  You can also always find a list of open positions at <a href="http://stackexchange.com/about/hiring,">http://stackexchange.com/about/hiring,</a> or click the “jobs” link in the footer of any Stack Exchange site.</p>

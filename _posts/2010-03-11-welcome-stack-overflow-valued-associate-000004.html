I am pleased to announce that <b>Stack Overflow just added another team member in an officially paid capacity: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/80572/kevin-montrose">Kevin Montrose</a></b>.</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/kevin-montrose-big.jpg" alt="" title="kevin-montrose-big" /></p>
<p>
You may remember Kevin as the author of the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/what-would-a-stack-overflow-api-look-like/">unofficial Stack Exchange API</a>.</p>
<p>
I didn't realize at the time that Kevin was graduating from <a href="http://www.rice.edu/">Rice University</a> in Houston, TX and actively looking for employment. But when I finally noticed Kevin had <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/kevin-montrose">his Stack Overflow Careers CV</a> linked in his profile, even someone as dense as myself was able to put 2 and 2 together -- working on an API is our highest priority, and we're looking to hire <i>exactly</i> the kind of programmers who roll up their sleeves and say "no Stack Overflow API after almost two years? To heck with you guys, I'll just <a href="http://code.google.com/p/stackexchange-api/">write my own!</a>"</p>
<p>
(I'm paraphrasing a little -- I'm sure Kevin didn't actually say that. Or, maybe he did. I don't know.)</p>
<p>
Kevin is still a student at Rice until May, so our desire for someone to start part time meshed nearly perfectly with his schedule. Kevin cut his teeth developing a few pending features for <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">careers.stackoverflow.com</a> and we've been quite pleased with the results. He's now actively working with Stack Overflow Associates #00001, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00002/">#00002</a>, and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00003/">#00003</a> to make sure version 1.0 of the Stack Overflow API can be as solid and complete as possible.</p>
<p>
As a student, Kevin is working with whatever equipment he has at hand. I made sure that he got upgraded to a nice 30" monitor and a brand new, fully decked out 8 GB, Core i5 laptop. Every team I am on will religiously enforce the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/08/the-programmers-bill-of-rights.html">Programmer's Bill of Rights</a>.</p>
<p>
Congratulations, Kevin. Welcome to the Stack Overflow core team. We're certainly hoping you will want to continue this part-time gig as a full-time gig later this year!</p>
<p>
I should also note that big things are happening with Stack Overflow right now, some of which <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2010/02/14.html">Joel has written about</a>. It's very exciting and I think you'll really like what we reveal, but we can't talk about the details of that yet, unfortunately. I can, however, assure you that <b>we're very likely to expand the core team by several more members in the near future</b>. And yes, we <i>will</i> be <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/eating-our-own-careers-dogfood/">eating more of our own careers dogfood</a> -- that is, hiring from the Stack Overflow (and Server Fault) community. </p>
<p>
Remember: we're all here to build something we love together!</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p>

<p>
Joel's vacation in France is going <i>so very swimmingly</i> that he has declined to participate in the Stack Overflow podcast for yet another week.</p>
<p>

<p>
I'm not one to judge, but <b>apparently Joel loves France more than he loves Stack Overflow</b>. I'm just sayin'.</p>
<p>
But, maybe we can pull something together sans Joel. There are some <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/14303/podcast-66-discussion-ideas-unofficial">ideas on meta for the as-yet-unrecorded Podcast #66</a>, so feel free to go in there and upvote or add your own.</p>
<p>
<small>(disclaimer: I'm just kidding, I have nothing against France. It's Australia that <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/02/new-question-answer-rate-limits/">really sucks</a>.)</small></p>
<p /></p></p>

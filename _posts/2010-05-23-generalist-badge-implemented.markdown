After a whopping 18 month gestation, we've finally implemented the [Generalist badge](http://stackoverflow.com/badges/15/generalist).



The Generalist badge works as follows:





<blockquote>
Provided non-wiki answers of **15** total score in **20** of the top **40** tags.
</blockquote>





The top 40 tag list is surprisingly diverse across the entire Trilogy. Just check out the top 40 tags (as of this writing) on Stack Overflow:

One thing the badge doesn't say, is that **there must be at least 200 questions in all 40 of the top tags before this badge is awarded to anyone**. That's why you won't see it on meta for a bit longer, or any new sites for about a year. I don't feel you can accurately measure a generalist until the top tag list settles down.



The intent of this badge is to **reward those folks who are answering a variety of questions across multiple skill sets**, not spending all their time in the same set of tags.



Now, it is true that the top 40 tags shift over time; for example Android went from #36 to #27 just in the last month. Rest assured, if you earn the Generalist badge, like any other badge in our system -- barring exceptional circumstances -- it won't be revoked.

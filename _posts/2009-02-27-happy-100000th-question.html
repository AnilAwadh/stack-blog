I've been remiss in not celebrating an important Stack Overflow milestone. Sometime on Wednesday, February 25th, a user asked.. </p>
<p><h2>Our 100,000th Question!</h2>
<p>
<img src="assets/birthday-cake-animated.gif" alt="birthday-cake-animated" title="birthday-cake-animated" width="340" height="290" /></p>
<p>
I didn't say it was a <i>good</i> question, mind you. But it <i>was</i> the hundred thousandth question posted to Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>
So, for reference -- and remember our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/07/stack-overflow-private-beta-begins/">private beta</a> started on 7/31/2008, and the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/09/then-a-miracle-occurs-public-beta/">public beta</a> on 9/15/2008 -- here's how many questions and answers have been posted to date, by month:</p>

We are pretty regularly doing <b>500k pageviews per day now</b>. Geoff has also been tracking our bandwidth usage through <a href="http://www.cacti.net/">the most excellent Cacti tool</a>. Here's what the last 24 hour period looks like:</p>
<p>

<p>
So far:</p>
<ul>
<li>peak of 6 Mbit/sec or 750 KB/sec
</li>
<li>average of 4 Mbit/sec or 512 KB/sec
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That's actually a lot for a site like ours which is nearly 100% text with precious few images.</p>
<p>
And compressed text at that! We've <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2007/07/high_performanc_3.html">had the GZIP religion for a long time</a>, but last night we went through and double checked everything to be sure. I did some port 80 sniffing and found a few cases where content wasn't served up compressed, even when the client asked for it. Looking for commonalities and doing research, I discovered that <b>HTTP 1.0 traffic and proxy traffic wasn't being compressed</b>. Turns out those are both <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms690689.aspx">off by default in IIS 7</a>. I turned them on like so:</p>
<p><pre>
%windir%\system32\inetsrv\appcmd set config 
    /section:httpCompression /noCompressionForHttp10:false
%windir%\system32\inetsrv\appcmd set config 
    /section:httpCompression /noCompressionForProxies:false
</pre>
<p>
I was surprised how many proxies actually identify themselves as HTTP 1.0, given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">how ancient HTTP 1.1 is</a>. It's especially ironic considering many of these very same proxies <i>asked</i> for gzip content -- I'm not sure GZIP compression is even valid under HTTP 1.0.</p>
<p>
But I digress. <b>Congratulations to everyone who has helped make Stack Overflow a success by asking and answering questions.</b> Here's to many more years of learning together!</p>

If you've ever been unfortunate enough to see our "workin on ur problemz" <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/error">Stack Overflow error page</a> ...</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/error-lolcat-problemz.jpg" alt="" title="error-lolcat-problemz" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>
... let me apologize on behalf of our team.</p>
<p>
I originally found this image in some random image search and added the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolcat">lolcat</a> caption myself. I've often wondered where this image came from, and what sort of computer the cat in it is "using", but I thought sourcing the image would be impossible.</p>
<p>
But nothing is impossible for our talented community of users -- they totally nailed this one! Let's start with <b><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/38765/andrew-grimm">Andrew Grimm</a></b> who was curious enough to finally ask on meta: <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/37597/what-kind-of-computer-is-being-used-in-workin-on-ur-problemz">What kind of computer is being used in “Workin on ur problemz”?</a></p>
<p>
<b><a href="http://superuser.com/users/3110/gnoupi">Gnoupi</a></b> identified the computer as a "V-Tech Talking Whiz Kid Mouse PRO Deluxe". It's a now-obsolete toy computer for children; even the <i>newer</i> models of this series from VTech are no longer sold. The only pictures available are from eBay auctions.</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/658/kyle-cronin">Kyle Cronin</a></b> sourced the photo and the cat, Zoe, from a <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/oddly-enough/2007/10/11/just-too-obvious-cat-and-mouse/">Reuters Oddly Enough blog entry</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Zoe, a domestic shorthair cat, touches the mouse of a computer during a media preview for The Cat Fanciers’ Association’s championship in New York October 10, 2007.</p>
<p>

</blockquote>
<p>
I found that eBay auction I mentioned above too tempting to resist ... </p>

<p>
so now my son Henry (aka <a href="http://twitter.com/rockhardawesome">Rock Hard Awesome</a>) can be WORKIN ON UR PROBLEMZ, too!</p>
<p>
(A special thanks to Gnoupi, Kyle Cronin, and Andrew Grimm. You guys are awesome. Also, who knows where this laptop might end up next? The possibilities are truly <i>endless!</i>)</p>

I recently had a <a href="http://meta.gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/1455/what-is-the-point-of-help-me-remember-this-game-questions">long discussion</a> on gaming meta regarding "Help me remember this game" questions. I'll spare you all the gory details; my general conclusion was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If we get an excellent user who asks a <i>good, thoughtful</i> [game] identification question and sticks around in our community to participate, then it's worth allowing it in those rare cases as a high quality "getting to know you" fun question.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This reminded me of a conversation I once had on <a href="http://chat.serverfault.com">Server Fault Chat</a> about <code>mod rewrite</code> questions. This is a true gray area in our network. It's tricky, because any given URL rewriting question could legitimately be on topic for multiple sites, each with a different core audience:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://serverfault.com">Server Fault</a> (sysadmins)
</li>
<li><a href="http://stackexchange.com">Stack Overflow</a> (programmers)
</li>
<li><a href="http://webmasters.stackexchange.com">Webmasters</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I don't think a black and white "all URL rewriting questions belong on {site}" ruling would be helpful in these gray areas. What matters most is <b>the <i>context</i> of the question</b>. You need to use your judgment to look at the bigger picture around the question: is this person a system administrator? a webmaster? a programmer? Even the 'same' URL rewriting question can have different solutions depending on which audience it's being presented to.</p>
<p>
That's why I recommend considering these gray area questions in the context of the <i>user</i>. <b>Does this user <i>belong</i> here on this site with us?</b> Or is it the guy in the nerdy suit who just walked into the biker bar?</p>

<blockquote><p>
[Pee-Wee Herman walks into a noisy, rowdy, crowded biker bar. He puts a coin in the pay phone and begins dialing.]</p>
<p>Pee-Wee:<br />
What? I'm sorry, operator. I can't hear you. [turns to the bikers, yelling in exaggerated fashion] <i>Shhh!</i> I'm <i>trying</i> to use the phone!</p>
<p>[The bikers all grow quiet and circle around Pee-Wee at the pay phone. The lead biker hangs up the phone.]   </p>
<p>Biker:<br />
Did anybody tell you that this is the private club of the Satan's Helpers?</p>
<p>Pee-Wee:<br />
Nobody hipped me to that, dude!   </p>
<p>Biker:<br />
It's off-limits!</p>
<p>Pee-Wee:<br />
Oh. Well, <i>my mistake</i>. Ha ha! Guess I'll be on my way, then! Ha ha!</p>
<p>[Pee-Wee tries to innocently exit, pushing his way gently outward against the tightly grouped circle of bikers surrounding him.]</p>
<p>Pee-Wee:<br />
Excuse me! Excuse me. Ha ha! <i>Excuse</i> me! Excuse me.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
(There's no way I can do this brilliant scene justice in text, so you should <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVKsd8z6scw">watch the clip on YouTube</a>. This is of course from the timeless movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089791/">Pee-Wee's Big Adventure</a>.)</p>
<p>
Anyway, my point is this: when you have to make judgment calls about questions in the gray area of mildly off-topic -- <b>apply the Pee-Wee Herman Rule!</b></p>
<ol>
<li>If you have reason to believe, based on the context, quality, and content of the question, that <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">this user could potentially be a positive contributor to your community</span> -- I'd be inclined to let their question stay.
</li>
<li>If you have reason to believe, based on the context, quality, and content of the question, that this user would <i>not</i> be a positive contributor to your community -- I'd be inclined to close the question, or migrate it somewhere else where they'd fit in better.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This is not meant to be an exclusionary rule. It's more of a general measurement of how committed new users are to at least <i>trying</i> to fit in to the community they just walked in to. As Pee-Wee proved, being the nerdy guy in the biker bar can work -- so long as you're willing to dance the Tequila song with us.</p>

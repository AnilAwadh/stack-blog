<p>We've been busy! So busy, in fact, that this post only takes us through the hires we made in June and July. More announcements are coming soon ... in the meantime, get to know these 13 wonderful people who now call Stack Exchange home.</p>
<p><b><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-13772" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-right: 2em;" alt="Ericson, Jon" src="assets/Ericson-Jon.png" width="200" height="200" /></b></p>
<p><b>Jon Ericson, Community Manager, </b><em>Burbank, CA</em></p>
<p>As an Air Force brat, Jon grew up all over the world but has lived in the Los Angeles area since attending UCLA, marrying his college sweetheart, and starting a family. He taught himself GW-BASIC on the family Tandy 1000, learned Pascal and FORTRAN in the classroom, C on the job, Perl on Usenet, and a bunch of other stuff on Stack Exchange. Fifteen years after getting his dream job subcontracting for NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, he leaves with an unblemished record in terms of spacecraft unplanned planetary impact maneuvers.

She worked as a marketing manager in Spain, France, and the UK, fitting in a couple of ski seasons in between, before deciding to travel the world. In 2009 she settled down in what is now properly her home: London!  Angela has a background in marketing for the gaming industry, having run one of Europe's largest poker tours, The WPT, for years.

<p>Samo (left) grew up in Ljutomer, studied in Maribor, and now lives in Lenart - all in the "head" of Slovenia's chicken-like geography. He got into programming by maintaining his high school's website and developing applications for organizing karate competitions. Besides hanging out with his wife, he also enjoys making music, practicing &amp; judging karate, other (normal) sports, and learning new things by answering questions on Stack Overflow. As an active SO user since 2009, Samo wasn't able to resist the temptation any longer, and he clicked on the '<a href="http://static.adzerk.net/Advertisers/83548ab0d32849899a38e743d918ed91.png" target="_blank">woof from home</a>' ad - once.</p>

<p>Born and raised in a tiny village in Hampshire complete with thatched-roofed cottages, Tania has been living in London in the heart of the Olympic Village for over 4 years. Tania designed an award winning doughnut aptly named 'Death By Chocolate' which was available in petrol (gas) stations across the UK for a limited period. Due to the over consumption of doughnuts, Tania decided the best way to work the extra calories off was by running the London Marathon, which she did in 2013. When she's not busy checking out the latest pop up restaurant she can be found with her nose in a good book or learning to swim...sometimes both!</p>

<p>Remember that <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/do-trilogy-sites-need-a-third-place/">third place concept</a> I brought up a few months ago?</p>
<p>We're ready to give community insiders a chance to check out what <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/06/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associates-00006-and-00007/">Stack Overflow Valued Associates #00006 and #00007</a> have been working so hard on.</p>
<p>For the next 3 days, we'll be running a public beta sneak preview of our proposed "third place" for all new (and existing) Stack Exchange network sites. Let's take <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1288/food-and-cooking">the Food and Cooking site proposal</a> -- which is currently in private beta -- as an example. On the very first day of the private and public betas, we'd have:</p>
<pre>
     cooking.stackexchange.com
<font color="maroon">meta</font>.cooking.stackexchange.com
<font color="maroon">chat</font>.cooking.stackexchange.com
</pre>
<p>Because you not only need a place to have <b>intelligent Q&A about bacon</b>, you need a place to talk <i>about</i> the place, and a less formal "third place" to collaborate in real time with the fellow members of your community.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bacon-tuxedos-lr.jpg" alt="" title="bacon-tuxedos-lr" width="400" height="285" /></p>
<p>We already have the per-site metas, which work great, but we don't <i>quite</i> have that third place ready yet. But we'd like to ... soon. That's where you come in.</p>
<ol>
<li>You must have a <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com">Meta Stack Overflow</a> account with at least <b>20</b> reputation.
</li>
<li>Make sure you're first logged in to meta, because we use a shared cookie for authentication.
</li>
<li>Hop on over to <b>chat.meta.stackoverflow.com</b> and enter the password "gossipville".
</li>
</ol>
<p>Have fun -- and be sure to leave your feedback for us either on meta in a question tagged [chat], or in the chat itself in the appropriately named "Chat Feedback" room.</p>
<p><font color="red">Update</font>: beta preview complete! thanks for all your feedback.</p>

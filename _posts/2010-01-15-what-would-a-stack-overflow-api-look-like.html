<p>
We are now gearing up to build the first official Stack Overflow API.</p>
<p>
Please bear in mind that <b>the first version of the API will be read-only by design</b>. We'd rather attack the much harder problem of writing (that is, submitting questions, answers, and comments) in V2 with improvements rolled in from our experience having the read-only V1 API out there first.</p>
<p>

<p>
To get an idea of what working with this imaginary Stack Overflow API <i>could</i> look like, browse the project <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/80572/kevin-montrose">Stack Overflow user Kevin Montrose</a> set up:</p>
<p><h2>Stack Exchange API on Google Code</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/stackexchange-api/">Project homepage</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://stackexchange-api.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/index.htm">Documentation</a>
</li>
<li>Documentation for the current Stack Overflow "API" <a href="http://code.google.com/p/stackexchange-api/wiki/CurrentAPI">it uses</a> (warning: bad, incomplete, broken, unsupported)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To be 100% clear, <font color="maroon">we are NOT blessing this as an official API</font>, but we'd like to take advantage of the hard work Kevin has rolled into his code to help produce <b>a proper Stack Overflow API that doesn't suck</b>. </p>
<p>
Because what currently passes for an API on Stack Overflow was never truly intended as such, it's important to regard what's in place now as a preliminary sketch, a temporary crutch, a placeholder for something better. </p>
<p>
To produce a decent read-only V1 API for Stack Overflow, we need your input:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read through <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged?tagnames=api&sort=votes">the highest voted questions tagged [api]</a> on meta.
</li>
<li>Browse Kevin's document <b><a href="http://code.google.com/p/stackexchange-api/wiki/DesiredSOApi">Desired Stack Overflow API</a></b> which is based on his experience writing SXAPI.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Done? Good.</p>
<p>
Now, <b>what do you want to build that uses the API?</b> The perfect API for this task, called from your preferred programming language, would do ... what, exactly? What's clean? What's simple? What's supportable and scalable?</p>
<p>
If WordPress comments are too limiting, and you'd like to post some code samples or use Markdown formatting, feel free to use <b><a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/33397/sxapi-a-net-api-for-so-f-u-meta-updated-to-version-4-0">the SXAPI Meta question</a></b> to do so -- or any place on Meta, really, as long as it's <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/api">properly tagged with [api]</a>.</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p></p>

I'm pleased to announce that <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/11/careers-employer-beta-underway/">the employer beta</a> is now complete, and <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow Careers</a> is now fully open for business!</p>
<p>

<p>
The <b>employers and hiring managers</b> rates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 week subscription is <b>$500</b></li>
<li>1 month subscription is <b>$1,000</b></li>
<li>6 month subscription is <b>$3,000</b></li>
<li>1 year subscription is <b>$5,000</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
Employers can <font color="red">give our search interface a spin for free</font>, to see total match counts and get an idea of how many candidates they'll be looking at with a subscription. As always, this whole thing is backed by our 90 day no-questions-asked total satisfaction policy. Got more questions? We've documented everything in the <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/faq">faq</a>.</p>

<p>
Although November and December are not exactly <i>banner</i> months for hiring, we have a solid stable of employers already using the site -- many of whom were <a href="http://jobs.stackoverflow.com/">already participating on jobs.stackoverflow.com</a>. They're searching through filed CVs, and actively sending messages to candidates that look promising. So keep those CVs in good shape for January!</p>
<p>
If <i>your</i> company is hiring top software engineers, I encourage you to <b>check out <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow Careers!</a></b></p>

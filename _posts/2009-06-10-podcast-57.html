<p>This is the 57th episode of the StackOverflow podcast where Joel and Jeff discuss the relationship between speed and skill, iPhone development, and the value of programming fundamentals.</p>
<ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>Joel comments on the surprising correlation between how fast you can solve a simple problem, and your overall skill level as a programmer. This is why giving even a very experienced programmer a simple problem can still work. If you can't truly master the fundamentals, it's hard to work at higher levels of abstraction.</li>
<li>We agree with Paul Graham: in general, there tends to be a correlation between the length of a response and its quality. We've also observed this pattern on Stack Overflow. It isn't <em>always</em> true (TL;DR), but it's a verifiable pattern. Either be the first and quickest, or be the best and most comprehensive!</li>
<li>Due to high demand, five new cities were added to the <a href="http://devdays.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow DevDays</a>: Boston, Austin, Los Angeles, Cambridge (UK), and Amsterdam.</li>
<li>I was quite impressed with the striking design Mike Kus put together for the Stack Overflow DevDays website. He <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/features/the-evolution-of-a-website-design/">breaks it down step by step</a> for us. Like most programmers, I'm a terrible designer, but at least I know what's <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000152.html">good enough to steal!</a></li>
<li>As promised, we released a <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/stack-overflow-creative-commons-data-dump/">creative commons data dump</a> of all the Stack Overflow data including all questions and answers. We're excited to see what the community can do with this data; Brent Ozar put together a <a href="http://sqlserverpedia.com/blog/sql-server-tutorial/data-mining-the-stackoverflow-database/">data mining video</a> to get people started.</li>
<li>Stack Overflow has become a very popular destination for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/iphone">iPhone development</a>. This is completely accidental, but it is a valid reflection of the vibrant and growing iPhone development community. If you're an iPhone developer, check out the <a href="http://www.mobileorchard.com">Mobile Orchard</a> website and <a href="http://www.mobileorchard.com/category/podcast/">podcast</a>, which even has a <a href="http://www.mobileorchard.com/best-of-stack-overflow-for-iphone-devs/">best of Stack Overflow for iPhone developers</a>!</li>
<li>Joel and I are tremendously impressed with <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/">Apple's development push for the iPhone</a>, including the App Store. It is remarkably Microsoft-like, in a good way -- it's completely driven by <em>developers, developers, developers!</em> "If you want to be a mobile developer, your #1 choice has to be Apple."</li>
<li>Some comments on the sad state of Windows Mobile (rumored <a href="http://silverlight.net/learn/mobile.aspx">Silverlight reboot</a>), <a href="http://wave.google.com/">Google Wave</a> (go HTML 5!) and the <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/phones/pre/">Palm Pre</a> (is HTML/JavaScript/CSS a viable development platform)?</li>
<li>One downside of discussing questions on the podcast is that it leads to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">Hawthorne effect</a>, and sometimes radically changes the state of the question.</li>
<li>Joel recommends <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0131103628/?tag=codinghorror-20">The C Programming Language</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/013937681X/?tag=codinghorror-20">The Unix Programming Environment</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262032937/?tag=codinghorror-20">Introduction to Algorithms</a> as solid books for programmers who want to brush up on their fundamentals and potentially do well at programming interviews.</li>
<li>We recommend checking out Jason Calacanis' podcast, <a href="http://thisweekinstartups.com/">This Week in Startups</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>
<ol>
<li>Josh Hunt: "The first answer to my question, the answer that got the higest number of votes, was not correct -- has Stack Overflow failed in the 'first answer is best' aspect?" and "We've been taught algorithms in our high school using pseudocode. What do you think of this?"</li>
<li>"If I've applied for a job at Fog Creek (or anywhere else) and didn't quite make it, what can I do to improve myself as a programmer and have a better chance next time?"</li>
</ol>
<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/895371/bubble-sort-homework">Bubble Sort Homework</a>. Homework questions are frowned upon on Stack Overflow, but there is a right way to ask them -- and a way to get the community to help you while helping each other.</li>
</ul>

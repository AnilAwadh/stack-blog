<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2635/simucal">Simucal</a> asks:</p>
<blockquote><p>
What is SO's peak time of day in terms of number of users on the site?  I'm curious because there are times when I want to ask a fairly niche question and asking when the most number of users are on might be beneficial.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I did a quick query on non-deleted revisions, grouped by hour of day GMT time. Here's what I came up with.</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/stack-overflow-revision-dates-by-hour.png" alt="stack-overflow-revision-dates-by-hour" title="stack-overflow-revision-dates-by-hour" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-304" /></p>
<p>
Looks like the most popular time to post is between 15:00 and 22:00 GMT/UTC, at least for all Stack Overflow data between launch and today.</p>
<p>
You'll have to convert those GMT hours to your local time zone, of course. For the USA, that's:</p>
<table width="400">
<tr>
<td>Eastern Standard Time</td>
<td>GMT/UTC minus 5 hours</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Central Standard Time</td>
<td>GMT/UTC minus 6 hours</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mountain Standard Time</td>
<td>GMT/UTC minus 7 hours</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pacific Standard Time</td>
<td>GMT/UTC minus 8 hours</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
I'm a PST guy, so for <i>me</i> that means the best time to post a question I needed an answer to ASAP would be at the beginning of this activity peak -- very early in the morning, probably around 7 AM to 8 AM. Ugh.</p>

<p>Every Stack Exchange question and answer pair is intended to be an <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/">evergreen, editable resource for future travelers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The editing feature is there so that old question/answer pairs can get better and better. For every person who asks a question and gets an answer on Stack Exchange, hundreds or thousands of people will come read that conversation later. Even if the original asker got a decent answer and moved on, the question lives on and may continue to be useful for decades.</p>
<p>This is fundamentally different from Usenet or any of the web-based forums. It means that Stack Exchange is not just a historical record of questions and answers. It's a lot more than that: it's actually a community-edited wiki of narrow, "long-tail" questions -- questions that aren’t quite important enough to deserve a page on Wikipedia, but which come up over and over again.
</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Editing is what you might call a <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/in-defense-of-editing/">family value</a> on our network.</b> All the content you generously contribute to any <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">Stack Exchange site</a> is licensed to us, you, and the rest of the world <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/stack-overflow-creative-commons-data-dump/">under Creative Commons</a> with the explicit promise that future visitors can help us improve it and keep it up to date -- largely through editing.</p>
<p>To get an idea of just how much editing goes on, here's a snapshot of edits performed on Stack Overflow between February 1, 2011 and July 8, 2011:</p>
<p><img src="assets/regular-edits-stack-overflow-feb-july-2011.png" alt="" title="regular-edits-stack-overflow-feb-july-2011" width="600" height="256" /></p>
<p>One of the primary ways we try to encourage editing is by <b>making it easier to edit</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We added <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/new-10k-feature-inline-tagging/">inline tagging</a> in April 2010, which made it much faster for high reputation users to retag questions.</li>
<li>We added <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/suggested-edits-and-edit-review/">suggested edits</a> in February 2011, which opened up the world of edits to anonymous users and users with 2,000 or less reputation.</li>
</ul>
<p>How much of the editing total do anonymous and regular users contribute? Here's a snapshot of suggested edits performed on Stack Overflow for the same time period; the green line is registered users, and the blue line is anonymous users.</p>
<p><img src="assets/suggested-edits-stack-overflow-feb-july-2011.png" alt="" title="suggested-edits-stack-overflow-feb-july-2011" width="600" height="258" /></p>
<p>So, about <b>one quarter</b> of all edits are suggestions from anonymous and regular users. Only a tiny trickle are from anonymous users, on the order of 10 to 30 per day. (If you're wondering why anonymous edits doubled in June, we made a copy change on the site that helped. Try browsing the site in incognito / inprivate / private browsing mode and see if you can tell what it is.)</p>
<p>We think the current level of editing is admirable -- and climbing -- but we are deeply concerned that there's not nearly enough editing to keep up with the corpus of almost 2 million questions on Stack Overflow. The English Wikipedia currently has <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias#All_Wikipedias_ordered_by_number_of_articles">about 3.6 million articles</a>, so <b>if you think of every Stack Overflow question as a potentially editable article, we <i>already</i> have more than half the footprint of Wikipedia to maintain and keep up to date</b>. A scary thought as Stack Overflow nears its <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/08/one-year-of-stack-overflow/">third birthday</a>.</p>
<p>To address this concern, we relied on another of our core family values: <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/06/performance-is-a-feature.html">performance is a feature</a>. That is, if you want more editing &hellip; <i>make editing faster!</i></p>
<p>That's why I'm pleased to announce that <b>we now support inline editing on all Stack Exchange sites</b>. There's no longer any need to visit a separate editing page; simply click "edit" and begin editing the post <i>right there on the question page</i>.</p>
<p><img src="assets/stack-exchange-inline-editing.gif" alt="" title="stack-exchange-inline-editing" width="600" /></p>
<p>This is a much faster method of editing, as the above animation demonstrates. (And for optimal speed, remember to press <kbd>tab</kbd>, <kbd>tab</kbd>, <kbd>space</kbd> to save your edit -- we even built in a little <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd> shortcut to jump right to saving the edit.)</p>
<p>We've only opened up inline editing to editors (users with 2,000+ reputation) for now, but we might extend it to all users eventually. And if you prefer the old editing page for whatever reason, just hold down <kbd>ctrl</kbd> when clicking on edit to get it.</p>
<p>What’s so special about editing? You might as well ask what’s so special about editing on Wikipedia? Uh... <i>everything?</i> So go forth, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold">be bold</a>, and <b>exercise your new, faster inline editing skills!</b></p>

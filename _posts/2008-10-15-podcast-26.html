<p>
This is the twenty-sixth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff answer five listener questions, mostly about social software design. Warning: this podcast features cowbell. Really.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Christopher Leary</strong>: "Any thoughts on the general design of karma and rep systems based on your experience building one for Stack Overflow?"</li>
<li><strong>Michael L Perry:</strong> "What about a system where votes by people who have more reputation count more?"</li>
<li><strong>Jeff Metzner</strong>: "If I post personal anecdotes as an answer to a question, is it reasonable for other users to edit that?"</li>
<li><strong>Anonymous: </strong>"Why can't we ask IT questions? What about a sister site like Stack Overflow but for IT questions?"</li>
<li><strong>Miles Dennis:</strong> "For a cost-conscious startup, where do you see the balance between taking inexperienced staff that costs less, versus experienced staff that costs more?"</li>
</ul>

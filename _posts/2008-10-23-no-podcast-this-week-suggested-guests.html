<p>
There will be no podcast this week, because Joel is on a business trip to Korea, apparently at <a href="http://www.webappscon.com/2008/">webappscon</a>. I can't remember his exact words, but they were something along the lines of <i>"I don't care that the listeners want a new podcast, I am not a monkey who dances for their amusement!"</i> I tried in vain to reason with him, but you've heard how he is. </p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2006/04/14/thing-a-week-29-code-monkey/" style="border-bottom:none;"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/code_monkey_colour.jpg" alt="code monkey" title="code monkey" width="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>
But seriously, <b>one thing Joel and I want to do in future podcasts is have more guests on the show</b>. While we of course <i>loooove</i> talking about all things Stack Overflow and Fog Creek, it's also nice to open the floor up a bit and broaden our horizons.</p>
<p>
We have a few guests tentatively lined up for future shows through the end of the year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman of <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>
</li>
<li>Richard White of <a href="http://uservoice.com">UserVoice</a>
</li>
<li>Some of the fine folks who write and code <a href="http://www.woot.com/">woot.com</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://damienkatz.net/">Damien Katz</a> of CouchDB
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ericsink.com/">Eric Sink</a> of SourceGear
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'd like to open the comments up to suggestions. <b>Who would <i>you</i> like to hear Joel and I talk with on future Stack Overflow podcasts?</b></p>
<p>
And yes, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/10/a-question-about-questions/">Stack Overflow rules do apply</a> -- the guest does have to be at least peripherally "programming related", in theory anyway. :)</p>

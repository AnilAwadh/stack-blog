<p>Our community team has been growing by leaps and bounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00005/">Robert Cartaino</a> -- Palm Bay FL -- Apr 19, 2010
</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/welcome-valued-associate-rebecca-chernoff/">Rebecca Chernoff</a> -- St. Louis MO -- Jan 4, 2011
</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/welcome-valued-associate-dori-smith/">Dori Smith</a> -- Healdsburg CA -- Feb 25, 2011
</li>
</ul>
<p>We're serious about building community -- and <b>that means having a full time team dedicated to <i>you</i>.</b> The community team's role is to participate deeply on <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">our network of Q&A sites</a> and help figure out, with the assistance of the community, ways to for us to serve our community better -- in whatever form that takes.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to announce that, under the leadership of Robert Cartaino, we're adding a fourth member to the community team: <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/f29cc355f1bb4a008135233735f1ceba">Josh Heyer</a>, aka Shog9, from Colorado.</p>
<p><a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/f29cc355f1bb4a008135233735f1ceba"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/f29cc355f1bb4a008135233735f1ceba.png" width="208" height="58" alt="profile for Shog9 on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&A sites" title="profile for Shog9 on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&A sites" /></a></p>
<p>Josh will be an <b>adjunct community coordinator</b> working part time with the rest of the community team.</p>
<p>Josh is as old school as it gets; his <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/811/shog9">Stack Overflow user id is 3 digits</a>. I think it's fair to say he's been here from the absolute beginning -- not just on Stack Overflow, but on UserVoice (our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/cmon-get-meta/">first meta system</a>), through the birth of <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/">the original trilogy</a>, and beyond. Josh is an avid student of online community too, and he's grown with us as we've figured this stuff out. </p>
<p>I'm continually amazed how many smart people we have in our network who grok our mission of <b>high signal Q&A <i>that makes the internet better</i></b>, and are willing to volunteer their effort and insights to help us get there. I wish I could hire all of you. But until that time comes, Mr. Heyer will have to do. </p>

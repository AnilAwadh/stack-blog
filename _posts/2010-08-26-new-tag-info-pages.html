<p>
When we rolled out our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/tag-folksonomy-and-tag-synonyms/">tag synonym and tag wiki support</a>, I belatedly realized that tags were, completely by accident, third-class citizens in our ecosystem.</p>
<p>
By that, I mean <b>tags had no real page to themselves</b>. Think about it -- if someone asked you about the [java] tag on Stack Overflow, where would you send them? You can certainly link to all <i>questions</i> tagged Java, but there was no destination for the tag itself.</p>
<p>
Well, no longer. We've just rolled out much more comprehensive support for <b>tag pages</b> across the entire network.</p>
<p>
Clicking on a given tag &hellip;</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/question-tags-highlighted2.png" alt="" title="question-tags-highlighted" width="318" height="38" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4914" /></p>
<p>
&hellip; will always take you to a list of questions with that tag, as it always has, but you'll notice a new banner at the top of the page.</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/tag-page-house-ad1.png" alt="" title="tag-page-house-ad" width="600" height="190" /></p>
<p>
This banner shows an excerpt of the tag wiki, as well as directly linking to..</p>
<ul>
<li>the full wiki for this tag
</li>
<li>the list of <b>faq questions</b> for this tag
</li>
<li>statistics for this tag
</li>
<li><b>hot answers</b> in this tag
</li>
<li><b>new answers</b> in this tag
</li>
<li>synonyms for this tag
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The wiki, statistics, and synonyms aren't new, but we are continuing to progressively enhance them.</p>
<p><h2>FAQ questions</h2>
<p>
The more <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/new-linked-posts/">highly linked</a> a question is -- that is, it contains simple hyperlinks to or from another question on the site -- the more strongly it is considered a "frequently asked question" for its tag. Bottom line, if you want questions to appear on the FAQ for that tag, <b>link to them from other questions!</b></p>
<p><h2>Hot answers</h2>
<p>
Answers are considered hot for a tag when they are top-voted, not community wiki, and of sufficient length. Note that you can specify a time period of a day, week, month, year, or all time; what was hot today may not be hot for this week or month.</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/tag-hot-answers.png" alt="" title="tag-hot-answers" width="600" height="225" /></p>
<p><h2>New answers</h2>
<p>
It's exactly what you might think -- a simple chronological list of new answers provided within the tag, <i>right now</i>. </p>
<p>
<img src="assets/tag-new-answers.png" alt="" title="tag-new-answers" width="600" height="254" /></p>
<p>
(You'll note that we have a newly found focus on answers. We've realized that we spent <i>so</i> much time surfacing great questions in our engine that we really weren't giving great answers the publicity they often deserve. So we set out to fix that here!)</p>
<p>
If you're up to a bit of gardening in the tag of your choice, now you have a great destination hub to do exactly that -- in the tag pages. Getting to the tag pages is a bit more fiddly than I might like at the moment. We're still honing the navigation, but you can always form the URL manually &hellip;</p>
<p>

&hellip; or, just remember <b>to click the links at the top of the page when browsing tagged questions</b>.</p>

Remember that <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/05/stack-exchange-api-contest/">totally awesome Stack Exchange API contest</a> we announced on May 23rd? Specifically, one of the rules of the contest?</p>
<blockquote><p>
Your app must work against the final, 1.0 released version of the API. We’ll give you at least a week’s notice here on the blog when that’s closer to happening.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Well, if you're planning to enter this contest, you might want to get a move on -- the 1.0 release of the Stack Exchange API is imminent! We plan to <b>bless 1.0 of the API this Friday, July 9th</b>.</p>
<p>
Due to the many <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com">Area 51</a> sites we're launching, things are a bit busy. That's good news, though, for my fellow procrastinators -- it means we're extending the deadline for the API contest slightly. <b>We now plan to pick the contest winners in the first week of August.</b></p>
<p>
So, if you're thinking of <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/05/stack-exchange-api-contest/">entering the contest</a>, you still have a few weeks to build something prize-worthy.</p>

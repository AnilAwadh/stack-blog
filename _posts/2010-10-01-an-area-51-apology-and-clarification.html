<p>We'd like to apologize to the <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com">Area 51</a> community. </p>
<p>Allow me to explain with a diagram:</p>
<p><a href="http://peanuts.com/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/charlie-brown-lucy-football.png" alt="" title="charlie-brown-lucy-football" width="448" height="292" /></a></p>
<p>In this diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charlie Brown is the <b>Area 51 community</b>.
</li>
<li>Lucy Van Pelt is <b>Stack Overflow Internet Services Inc</b>.
</li>
<li>The football is the following proposals: <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/8494/developer-testing-unit-testing-and-more">Developer Testing</a>, <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/7848/compiler-design">Compiler Design</a>, and <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/14187/vi-vim-and-vixens">Vim</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>As Joel explained in <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/merging-season/">Merging Season</a>, if ...</p>
<blockquote><p>
1. Almost all X questions are on-topic for site Y<br />
2. Y already exists, it already has a tag for X, and nobody is complaining<br />
3. Thereâ€™s a high probability that users of site Y would enjoy seeing the occasional question about X
</p></blockquote>
<p>... then your proposal should be <b>closed as a duplicate</b> on Area 51, which has a close reason <i>precisely for this purpose!</i></p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/area-51-close-duplicate1.png" alt="" title="area-51-close-duplicate" width="554" height="187" style="border: 1px solid silver" /></p>
<p>Area 51 was always envisioned as a tool for broadening our scope -- for creating new sites serving <i>new topics</i> and answering questions that were <i>previously considered off-topic</i> on <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">our existing sites</a>. Area 51 was <i>never</i> intended as a tool for creating overlapping sub-sites that would <b>cannibalize users</b> from our existing sites!</p>
<p>We thought we made this clear in the <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq">Area 51 FAQ</a>, but apparently we didn't.</p>
<p>That said, <b>it is completely and utterly our fault</b> that we didn't stay on top of these overlapping proposals and close them as duplicates in a more timely fashion. It was unfair of us to let these proposals advance so far, when it is clear that they -- however well intentioned -- did not meet the spirit or letter of what Area 51 is for.</p>
<p>That is, as the kids say, "not cool." And I would like to apologize on behalf of Stack Overflow Internet Services for failing the community in this way.</p>
<p>Yes, this does mean that these proposals -- and, for that matter, any other proposals that would tend to drain audience away from existing Stack Exchange 2.0 sites -- will be closed as duplicates.</p>
<p>In the future, so we don't make these mistakes again, we plan to institute the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>be much more diligent about scrutinizing proposals <i>as they move to commitment phase</i>, not months later when they're at 80% commitment.
</li>
<li>try to build better vote-based tools that can assist proposals in merging together under <i>broader</i> topics so they have a stronger chance of surviving and defining their own unique topic space.
</li>
<li>strengthen the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/new-tag-info-pages/">tag page support</a> in our engine so sub-communities can prosper in a set of tags without feeling that they absolutely must <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/factionalism-site-or-tag/">"break out" into their own site</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>We're sorry. But we're only human, and we make mistakes too. Area 51 is something we love and are very excited about, but it's also new to us -- and we're learning about the process as we go along.</p>
<p>We hope you'll stick with it (and us) to see where it goes.</p>

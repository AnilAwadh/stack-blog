<p>Our program for world domination through stickers is well underway. Check out the cool stuff that Stack Overflow users have <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/09/how-to-get-stack-overflow-stickers/">sent in for stickers</a> to date:</p>
<p><a style="border-bottom: none;" href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/stack-overflow-stickers-mailed-stuff-large.jpg"><img title="stack-overflow-stickers-mailed-stuff" src="assets/stack-overflow-stickers-mailed-stuff.jpg" border="0" alt="stack-overflow-stickers-mailed-stuff" /></a></p>
<p>See, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/09/i-heart-stack-overflow/">Stack Overflow really is built on love, internet style!</a></p>
<p>I guess Joel wasn't kidding when he said <em>"just send us anything!"</em> in your SASE sticker request. Let's see what other kinds of crazy things we can get up on that wall -- <strong><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/09/how-to-get-stack-overflow-stickers/">request your stickers</a></strong> by sending in, y'know, <em>something!</em></p>
<p>Once you get the stickers, <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/20570/stickers-for-stackers-i-e-post-your-sticker-shots">post your sticker action shots</a> on meta, too!</p>
<p>And yes, I am still planning to send out <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/09/free-trilogy-stickers-for-top-users/">free stickers for top users on each Trilogy site</a>. Things are a bit backed up at the moment, but I expect to get all the free stickers mailed out by the end of October. These were mailed October 13th.</p>
<p>(I suppose this is as good a place as any to mention that there will be no podcast this week due to the flurry of activity necessary to support <a href="http://devdays.stackoverflow.com">DevDays</a> -- which <a href="http://stackoverflow.carsonified.com/events/boston/">kicks off tomorrow in Boston</a>. Stay tuned for some <strong>big</strong> announcements within 24 hours..)</p>

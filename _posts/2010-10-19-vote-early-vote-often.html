<p>Have you ever wondered why the vote buttons and score are so prominent on every <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">Stack Exchange</a> question?</p>
<p><img src="assets/voting-controls.png" alt="" title="voting-controls" width="109" height="205" style="border: 1px solid silver" /></p>
<p>Putting voting front and center is very much intentional; it is how ...</p>
<ul>
<li>good content is voted to the top
</li>
<li>wrong or incorrect content is voted to the bottom
</li>
<li>users who consistently provide useful content accrue reputation and are <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/membership-has-its-privileges/">granted more privileges</a> on the site
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>It's only through voting that a class of editors, closers, and moderators can emerge to help run and govern the site.</b> Voting is how site leadership forms. That's why <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/customizing-stackexchange-com/">the reputation leagues</a> show a breakdown of reputation spectrums. </p>
<p><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/customizing-stackexchange-com/"><img src="assets/se-reputation-spectrums.png" alt="" title="se-reputation-spectrums" width="411" height="335" /></a></p>
<p>Does your site have a healthy middle class of users with vote up and down, and edit tag <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/membership-has-its-privileges/">privileges</a>? Does it have a healthy governing class of users with edit, close, and moderation <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/membership-has-its-privileges/">privileges</a>? All of this requires sufficient reputation, which in turn requires users to <i>exercise their right to vote</i>.</p>
<p>In fact, we've begun showing beta site health on <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com">Area 51</a> as partially a function of how many "avid" users there are -- where "avid" is defined as <i>has at least 200 reputation</i>.</p>
<p><a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com"><img src="assets/area-51-avid-users.png" alt="" title="area-51-avid-users" width="489" height="116" /></a></p>
<p>(click through to any Area 51 site proposal that is currently in beta to see the evaluation.)</p>
<p>Our sites are all intended to be <b>a sort of representative democracy</b>. While <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/02/stack-overflow-2010-moderator-election-results/">yearly moderator elections</a> are an important part of that plan, voting on questions and answers is the primary mechanism through which the community governs the site on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>Voting is <i>so</i> important that we belatedly realized we may not be doing enough to encourage new users to vote. But we're trying to change that.</p>
<p><img src="assets/vote-here.jpg" alt="" title="vote-here" width="512" height="336" /></p>
<p>First, the new <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/membership-has-its-privileges/">privilege wikis and notifications</a> now explain the importance of upvoting and downvoting "just in time", when users receive those privileges.</p>
<p>Second, we're rolling out two new badges to further encourage additional dimensions of voting:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4">
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Suffrage</b>
</td>
<td valign="top">
Bronze
</td>
<td valign="top">
Cast the maximum number of 30 votes in a single day
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<b>Sportsmanship</b>
</td>
<td valign="top">
Silver
</td>
<td valign="top">
Cast 100 upvotes on competing answers, that is, answers to questions that you yourself answered with a score of 1 or more
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>These new voting badges will be applied retroactively, and complement the existing Supporter, Civic Duty, and Electorate voting badges.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Let each citizen remember at the moment he is offering his vote that he is not making a present or a compliment to please an individual -- or at least that he ought not so to do; but that he is executing one of the most solemn trusts in human society.</p>
<p style="text-align:right">&ndash; Samuel Adams</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Voting is as crucial to our community as it is to any democracy. As a moderator, or merely a citizen of the site -- please exercise your right to vote by <i>voting early and voting often!</i> </p>

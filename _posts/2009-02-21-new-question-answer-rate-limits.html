Stack Overflow is somewhat unique in that we encourage participation of essentially anonymous, random programmers. Our idea is to <b>radically reduce the bar for participation</b>, and take one giant leap of faith:</p>
<p><h2>Trusting our users.</h2>
<p>
Well, most of them, anyway. We have the typical hurdles in place to prevent bots from gaming our system: JavaScript and "too fast to be human" triggered CAPTCHA. This works in conjunction with community use of the <font color="maroon">offensive</font> flag, which auto-deletes any post after 5 users tag it "offensive", and traditional downvoting. This system has been fairly effective to date. We've only had a handful of spam and trolling, and it's all been handled with a minimum of fuss or impact to the typical Stack Overflow user.</p>
<p>
That is, until tonight, when we were hit by a malicious user of a type we haven't seen before:</p>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/stack-overflow-malicious-user.png" alt="stack-overflow-malicious-user" title="stack-overflow-malicious-user" style="border: 1px solid silver" /></p>
<p>
In a way, I suppose I should thank this user for doing this on a Friday night when traffic levels are pretty low. Here's my official response:</p>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vandalized-2pac.jpg" alt="vandalized-2pac" title="vandalized-2pac" /></p>
<p>
How does it feel when <i>we</i> vandalize <i>you</i>, Mr. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur">Tupac Shakur</a>? Eh? Not so good, I bet!</p>
<p>
But in all seriousness, the surprising thing here is that this user was <i>not</i> a bot. Our anti-bot stuff would be challenging to get around. <b>It was an actual human being, entering the CAPTCHAs, cutting and pasting text into every post.</b> We verified this by looking at the logs, and the timestamps on the entries. The times are slow and variable, not at all what you'd expect to see from a bot.</p>
<p>
Wow. How bored is <i>this</i> guy? (And yeah, it's always a guy, who are we kidding.) I'm not going to name any names, here, but we tracked all the IPs that this activity came from and they were all geographically similar.</p>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/the-country-which-shall-not-be-named.jpg" alt="the-country-which-shall-not-be-named" title="the-country-which-shall-not-be-named" /></p>
<p>
As if I needed <i>another</i> reason to hate Kangaroos and Koalas.</p>
<p>
I've been thinking for a while that we should have more stringent throttles on new users, <a href="http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/pages/general/suggestions/126742-limit-the-rate-at-which-a-user-can-submit-questions">rate limits for asking and answering questions</a>. This human spam storm was my excuse to implement them. So, effective immediately...</p>
<p><h2>If you're a new user, with reputation below 100:</h2>
<ol>
<h2 />
<li>You may only post 1 question every 20 minutes</li>
<h2 />
<li>You may only post 1 answer every 3 minutes</li>
</ol>
<p>
This is tracked at the IP address level, so multiple posts from the same IP, even as different "users", will still be blocked.</p>
<p>
So <i>take that, Australian wanna-be Tupac Shakur!</i></p>

<p>Well, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com">Windows 8</a> is finally available <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2411443,00.asp">in the wild</a>. Of course, developers have had access to it for quite a while - <a href="http://apptivate.ms/">our ongoing Apptivate contest</a> would be looking pretty sad otherwise. But now you can actually <em>buy </em>the upgrade for your home PC if you're so inclined, or for your mom's PC if you haven't been getting enough tech-support calls from her recently... </p>
<p>In recognition of this, <a href="http://blog.superuser.com/2012/10/22/windows-8-challenge/">Super User is running its own little promotion</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://win8challenge.com/">We’re having a party</a> and you’re invited. Ask and answer questions to complete the challenge levels, and complete different tasks like editing, voting, and blogging to win the eight tile challenges. Each level you beat and each tile you finish enters you for sweet prizes, including the grand prize of a Microsoft Surface RT!</p></blockquote>
<p>Let's face it: Windows 8 is a bit... <i>Different.</i> I haven't upgraded yet - it took Microsoft decades to finally get the taskbar working right, and I'm a bit reluctant to give that up. But if you do decide to take the plunge, <a href="http://superuser.com/">Super User</a> is <a href="http://blog.superuser.com/2012/08/27/the-super-users-windows-8-guide/">well-prepared</a> to help you through it - or if you've already been knee-deep in the change for a while (say, because of that app contest I mentioned above), perhaps you've learned something that could help others. Either way, why not double your pleasure by earning a <a href="http://win8challenge.com/">t-shirt, weird-looking mouse or other nifty gear</a> in the process?</p>

<p>Over the last 2.5 years, we've identified a few problematic classes of questions that tend to get asked on our sites. Many of these are documented in our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/new-question-migration-paths/">standard set of close reasons</a>: exact duplicate, off-topic, subjective and argumentative, not a real question, and too localized.</p>
<p>However, as we launched <a href="http://superuser.com/">the great Super User experiment</a>, a new, previously unknown class of problematic questions emerged -- the <strong>shopping recommendation</strong>.</p>
<p><img title="barbie-shopping" src="assets/barbie-shopping.jpg" alt="" width="365" height="550" /></p>
<p>That is, on <a href="http://superuser.com/">Super User</a> we began encountering questions like:</p>
<blockquote><p>Macbook Air vs. Macbook Pro?<br />
What's the best dual-band wireless router?<br />
Dell GX280 Processor upgrade?<br />
What RAM should I buy?<br />
Nvidia or ATI video card?</p></blockquote>
<p>These questions may seem tolerable at first glance. Isn't it our mandate to help our fellow <s>ewoks</s>users? But consider the voluminous amount of information you need to even <em>begin</em> properly answering a shopping question:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your budget?</li>
<li>Where do you live?</li>
<li>What are your preferences?</li>
<li>Which alternatives will you consider?</li>
<li>When do you want to buy?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's say the question asker provided all that information. Fat chance, I know, but let's pretend for a moment they did -- and we were able to provide the <em>perfect, ideal shopping recommendation</em> to them. Even if that was the case, technology moves so rapidly that <strong>the best shopping recommendations will be utterly obsolete within a year!</strong> What's the point of a bunch of labor intensive questions that provide only temporary benefit to a limited (some might say Too Localized) audience? There isn't any. That's what we concluded, and we <a href="http://meta.superuser.com/questions/1103/should-we-add-a-no-shopping-recommendation-clause-to-the-super-user-faq">explicitly disallowed</a> shopping questions in the <a href="http://superuser.com/faq">Super User FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Super User is for computer enthusiasts and power users. If you have a question about …</p>
<ul>
<li>computer hardware</li>
<li>computer software</li>
</ul>
<p>and it is <strong>not about</strong> …</p>
<ul>
<li>videogames or consoles</li>
<li>websites or web services like Facebook, Twitter, and WordPress</li>
<li>electronic devices, media players, cell phones or smart phones, except insofar as they interface with your computer</li>
<li><span style="background-color: #faf5c8;">a shopping or buying recommendation </span></li>
</ul>
<p>… then you're in the right place to ask your question!</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="howtoask"></a><br />
<strong>However</strong>, there <em>is</em> a way to ask these questions that avoids the inherent problems with shopping recommendations. For example, let's say you wanted -- as I did -- to buy a point-and-shoot camera that takes good low light photos. So we're going to ask on <a href="http://photo.stackexchange.com">photo.stackexchange.com</a>, naturally!</p>
<p>Here's one way to ask:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Q: What's the best low light point-and-shoot camera?</strong></p>
<p>A: Canon S90 and Lumix LX3.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="http://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/1373/what-point-and-shoots-are-good-in-low-light-conditions">another way</a> to ask:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Q: How do I tell which point-and-shoot cameras take good low light photos?</strong></p>
<p>A: I strongly recommend looking for something with</p>
<ul>
<li>a fast lens (2.0 at least)</li>
<li>reasonable ISO handling (at least 400, but preferably 800)</li>
<li>the biggest sensor available</li>
</ul>
<p>The sum of these factors are really critical for low light situations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The former question provides the path of least resistance: a laundry list of products I can buy without thinking about it too much. But that answer will only be valid for a year at best. The latter question may take some thinking, but its answer will be valid <em>forever</em> … or at least until camera technology somehow shifts beyond lenses and sensors as we know them today. Thus, when it comes to shopping questions, don't ask us what you should buy -- ask us <em>what you need to learn</em> to tell what you should buy.</p>
<p>If I had to summarize our network in a single word, <strong>that word is "learning"</strong>. People come to our sites to <em>learn</em> about topics they are passionate about. As the old Chinese proverb goes, "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime." Every question and answer ultimately should be about teaching and learning -- yes, even the shopping ones.</p>

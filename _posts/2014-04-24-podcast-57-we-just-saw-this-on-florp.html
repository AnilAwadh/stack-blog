<p>Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast #57, recorded Friday April 11, 2014 with your hosts Jay Hanlon, David Fullerton, and Joel Spolsky. Today's podcast is brought to you by the Heartbleed bug.</p>
<p>We have lots to talk about (which makes Joel scared), starting with <b>Community Milestones</b> (after we discuss 2048 strategy, that is)!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://expats.stackexchange.com/">Expats</a> is newly in public beta. It's a site for people that are dealing with the bureaucratic messes involved in living outside your home country. <a href="http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes">Check out their top-voted questions</a>.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions/146/can-i-lose-my-us-citizenship-for-accepting-employment-with-a-foreign-government">Can I lose my US citizenship for accepting employment within a foreign government?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions/3/how-do-i-deal-with-ppaca-obamacare-as-an-expatriate-us-citizen">How do I deal with PPACA ("Obamacare") as an expatriate?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions/118/how-to-build-credit-history-in-the-usa">How to build credit history in the USA?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions/143/where-can-i-be-tax-resident-when-i-dont-stay-in-any-eu-country-longer-that-6-mo">Tax residency when in the EU for less than 6 months</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And we've added yet another math site to the network: <a href="http://matheducators.stackexchange.com/">Math Educators</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/">Graphic Design</a> has graduated from public beta, and it now has its own beautiful design - check it out! (It's a great site, but it also helps Jay do <a href="http://imgur.com/OKVS5jx">things like this</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>That brings us to our <b>Community of the Week</b>: <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/">Information Security</a>. (For the record: horses <i>can</i> live in barns.) Info Security has gotten a lot of traffic lately thanks to our sponsor, the Heartbleed bug. (We wonder if we're spelling "security" wrong for a while before we realize the site is down. So we'll come back to this.)</p>
<p>Aaaanyway... let's talk about <b>New Features</b>.</p>
<ol>
<li>The iOS app is going to come out in the next 6-8 weeks, but you can still <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/228422/stack-exchange-ios-app-nearing-beta">sign up to test it for us</a> if you have an iPhone.</li>
<li>Also, we did an April Fool's prank about unicoins.</li>
<li>We're making some changes to the Community Wiki system.Â <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/04/putting-the-community-back-in-wiki/">There's a blog post here</a> if you'd rather fast forward through Jay's explanation.</li>
<li>We're also making changes to how protecting questions works, and we've <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/04/changes-and-guidelines-for-the-protected-question-status/">published a set of guidelines</a> for how to use that feature.</li>
</ol>
<p>That finishes the New Features segment... except for the other new features we're going to talk about. Breaking news: we're overhauling the profile page. (Stick with us in this part to hear Joel get bored and start talking about emo kid piercings!) There's a very outdated mockup <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/226177/the-profile-page-is-getting-a-makeover">here</a>.</p>
<p>Then, Joel gets so bored he brings up sports. On purpose. Several times. Also: <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Zastava_Yugo_311_1116cc.jpg">this is what a Yugo looks like</a>.</p>
<p><b>MOVING ON.</b> The gang invents a new game, and plays it for a while. Could this be a recurring segment? Tune in next week to find out! For now, we've killed enough time that Info Security is back online, so we'll talk about it for a while.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/55116/how-exactly-does-the-openssl-tls-heartbeat-heartbleed-exploit-work">How exactly does the OpenSSL TLS heartbeet (Heartbleed) exploit work?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/52115/dont-understand-how-my-mums-gmail-account-was-hacked">Don't understand how my mum's Gmail account was hacked</a></li>
<li><a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/4704/how-does-changing-your-password-every-90-days-increase-security">How does changing your password every 90 days incease security?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for joining us during this very productive hour of your life for Stack Exchange Podcast #57, brought to you by Heartbleed - the first buffer overflow bug with a website, a logo, and a marketing department.</p>

<p>
Just a quick note to the beta participants:</p>
<p>
We apologize for the recent spate of outages. We're currently diagnosing a sporadic hang in the website that we haven't quite got a handle on yet.  Until we figure it out, we're forced to restart the web service every few hours.</p>
<p>
I'll update this post when we get it licked, but until then, expect a bit more turbulence than usual. We appreciate your patience.</p>
<p>
Edit: Problem solved; <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/09/podcast-20/">see Podcast #20 for explanation</a>.</p>

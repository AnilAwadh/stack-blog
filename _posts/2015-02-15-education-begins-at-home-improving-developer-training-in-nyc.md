The core goal of Stack Exchange is education. Everything we build is geared toward helping people learn from one another — not just the nuts and bolts of their profession or passion, but the universal skills of how to better communicate and learn. As we’ve grown as a company, we’ve benefited from many resources to assist in educating developers out of our office space, including hosting [local meetups](http://www.meetup.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/events/206151292/) and partnering with the Flatiron School and Fog Creek for a [mentorship program](http://blog.flatironschool.com/post/107229276393/fog-creek-and-the-nyc-web-development-fellowship).

We really like the guys at <a href="http://www.woot.com/">woot!</a>, and not just because they're paying us to say that as a launch sponsor of <a href="http://serverfault.com/">Server Fault</a>.</p>
<p>
The woot team consists of developers and sysadmins like us, who happen to deal with some hard-core scaling problems. Such as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/450835/how-do-you-stop-scripters-from-slamming-your-website-hundreds-of-times-a-second">scripters who slam their site hundreds of times a second</a>. Ouch! </p>
<p>
They also have a clever crap-selling website that we've referred to more than once for UI ideas about data presentation. It is in that spirit that woot! approached us with a clever new concept for a badge:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Enthusiast</b> -- visited the site each day for 30 days.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
For the period of sponsorship, we've renamed this <a href="http://serverfault.com/badges/66/woot-enthusiast">the woot! badge</a>. (It'll revert to Enthusiast once that period is over.) It's now functional, as 30 days has elapsed <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/server-fault-public-beta-launches/">since the Server Fault launch</a>. So you can now identify all the <s>addicts</s><i>enthusiasts</i> who visited either site for 30 days in a row. </p>

<p>
What I like about this badge is that <b>it measures a dimension of engagement that we haven't before</b>. For a significant proportion of the users who earned this badge, it is their very first silver badge. It's OK to reward persistence and enthusiasm! (But we don't reward it <i>forever</i>; you can only earn this badge once.)</p>
<p>
In fact, we liked the results from the Enthusiast badge so much we added another level: <b>Fanatic</b>.</p>

<p>
And remember, this is a continuous award: if you don't visit the site for a single day, that will "break" your streak, and you'll have to start over.</p>

Good luck. You're gonna need it.</p>

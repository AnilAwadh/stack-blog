<p>
The Stack Overflow <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/stack-overflow-moderator-voting-now-open/">moderator election</a> is now complete.</p>
<p>
There were two users who clearly ran away from the pack in the voting: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/23354/marc-gravell">Marc Gravell</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1288/bill-the-lizard">Bill the Lizard</a>. Between the two of them, they accounted for almost a third of all the 2,880 votes cast.</p>

<p>
It was a tough choice determining such a close race -- so <i>we didn't!</i> <b>Both Bill and Marc are new Stack Overflow moderators</b>. I've posted some <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/">moderation guidelines</a> and flipped the switch on their accounts.</p>
<p>
As for <a href="http://serverfault.com">Server Fault</a>, that was tougher, because the community is <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/server-fault-public-beta-nears/">just starting out</a>. None of the existing Stack Overflow team is really qualified to moderate a site intended for system administrators and IT professionals.</p>
<p>
So we reached out to two members of the existing community who very generously volunteered their time to moderate: <a href="http://serverfault.com/users/1803">Kara Marfia</a> and <a href="http://serverfault.com/users/1674">Denny Cherry</a>.</p>
<p>

<p>
Eventually, once the Server Fault community matures, I expect to hold a moderator election there as well to bring another one or two online.</p>
<p>
(One thing we haven't addressed is how long a community moderator should be "elected" for; it seems like a good idea to hold periodic elections and let other trusted members of the community both relieve the existing moderators, and bring a fresh perspective to the mix.)</p>
<p>
At any rate, congratulations to Marc, Bill, Kara, and Denny. As always, please <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/">use your new powers for good and not evil!</a> <small><small>Unless someone really, <i>really</i> deserves it.</small></small></p>

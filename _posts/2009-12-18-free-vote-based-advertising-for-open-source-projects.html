I'm happy to announce that Stack Overflow's program of <b>free vote-based advertising for Open Source projects</b>, originally <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/23899/proposal-free-vote-based-advertising-for-open-source-projects">proposed back in September</a>, is now live!</p>
<p>
Some say <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/12/13.html">Stack Overflow is now the largest programming site on the internet</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/stackoverflow.com" style="border-bottom:none;"><img src="assets/daily-pageviews-alexa-graph.png" alt="daily-pageviews-alexa-graph" title="daily-pageviews-alexa-graph" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>
I'm not sure about that, but I can tell you that Stack Overflow <i>regularly</i> gets well over a <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/09/one-million-pageviews/">million pageviews per day</a>. While we've done <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/responsible-advertising-feed-a-programmer/">some responsible advertising</a> since March 2009, we still have a lot of excess (or "remnant") ad inventory, and more of it every day.</p>
<p>
Rather than let this go to waste, we thought it might benefit the programming community if we could <b>let the programming community use our remnant ad inventory space to publicize open-source projects in need of programmer assistance</b>.</p>
<p>
Here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit the special meta.stackoverflow.com question thread for this advertising period. It will <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/open-source-advertising">always be tagged [open-source-advertising]</a>.
</li>
<li>Construct a 220x220 image advertisement for the open source project that you would like to publicize to your fellow programmers.
</li>
<li>Post an answer containing your image to the question. It must be in <i>exactly</i> the right format, as documented in the question itself.
</li>
<li>Get at least (n) upvotes for your answer.
</li>
<li>Your advertisement will now be featured in Stack Overflow's remnant ad inventory, in the sidebar ad slot on most pages.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In other words, it goes directly from <b>this answer on the meta question</b>:</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/stack-overflow-open-source-ad-answer.png" alt="stack-overflow-open-source-ad-answer" title="stack-overflow-open-source-ad-answer" width="600" /></p>
<p>
To an advertisement to your fellow programmers on most pages of the Stack Overflow site itself:</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/stack-overflow-open-source-ad-live.png" alt="stack-overflow-open-source-ad-live" title="stack-overflow-open-source-ad-live" width="354" /></p>
<p>
I'm thrilled to see this go live, as I think it'll help get the word out about a lot of interesting open source projects that are in need of programmer input. Kudos to <a href="http://portmanwills.com/">Portman Wills</a>, who you may remember from our (sadly failed) <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/11/our-amazon-advertising-experiment/">Amazon ad experiment</a> -- he was instrumental in getting this done. (Have I mentioned how nifty his site <a href="http://shuffletime.com/c/codinghorror">shuffletime</a> is? Go check it out!)</p>
<p>
Now, while these ads are absolutely community driven, <b>we do reserve the right to exert editorial control and disallow any ads that we aren't comfortable running on our site</b>. Above all, they need to be (mostly) professional and on topic for our fellow programmers. The specific rules will always be in <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/open-source-advertising">the latest meta question tagged [open-source-advertising]</a>; please read carefully before posting.</p>
<p>
So, what are you waiting for? What open source project would <i>you</i> like to see publicized on Stack Overflow? Brush up on those Paintbrush or GIMP skills and <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/open-source-advertising">make it happen!</a></p>

Remember our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/why-cant-you-have-just-one-site/">League of (web) Justice?</a></p>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/justice-league-small.jpg" alt="justice-league-small" title="justice-league-small" /></p>
<p>
Well, I'm pleased to announce we have recruited another superhero into our league: <b><a href="http://doctype.com">Doctype</a></b>.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://doctype.com" style="border-bottom:none"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/doctype-logo.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>
<a href="http://doctype.com/about">What is Doctype?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
Doctype is a free question and answer site for web designers. You can get fast solutions to your CSS, HTML, web design and email design problems.</p>
<p>
For each question, <b>Doctype can generate screenshots of your design on any browser or email client</b>. This makes it much easier for other people to see the problem and help you fix it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Doctype was <i>inspired by</i> Stack Overflow, but <b>it was custom-built and tailored to the needs of web designers</b> by the fine folks at <a href="http://litmusapp.com/">Litmus</a>. Litmus is a tool designed to show how your HTML and CSS will render in a variety of different browsers and email clients, so naturally Doctype supports Litmus integration. When you ask those gnarly design questions, in addition to posting raw HTML and CSS, you can <i>also</i> post a set of automatically generated screenshots illustrating the design problem.</p>
<p>
Being "inspired by" Stack Overflow, the site also borrows generously from our concepts of reputation, tagging, and markup -- but with their own decidedly designer-ish bent.</p>
<p>
While we certainly encourage web design questions involving HTML and CSS on Stack Overflow, it's intended first and foremost for programmers. So if you're a web <i>designer</i>, and less of a programmer, you might find a better audience for your question (plus some cool auto-screenshot capabilities) at Doctype.</p>
<p>
What does this mean in practical terms?</p>
<ul>
<li>Our /faq will direct designers with pure HTML/CSS web design questions to Doctype, to better serve this subset of our audience.
</li>
<li>Our “hero roster” at the bottom of every page will offically list doctype.com as a member of the team.
</li>
<li><s>We will host Doctype discussion on meta, so the Doctype <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/20345/davidsmalley">developers</a> can participate and respond to community reactions and feedback for their site. </s>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
While this is a looser, less direct partnership than <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/howtogeek-and-stack-overflow/">the one with How-To Geek</a>, it does align well with our core Q&A format. By combining forces with How-To Geek and DocType, we're creating an even stronger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League">Justice League</a> on the web. All the better to serve our central mission: <b>getting the best possible answers to your questions</b>. Whatever those questions happen to be.</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p>

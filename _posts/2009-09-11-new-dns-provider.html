Our domain name registrar is GoDaddy. We've had a lot of problems with GoDaddy's handling of DNS, where DNS entries will suddenly appear and disappear at random. Often, changing a completely unrelated DNS record would result in other DNS entries going missing for hours. Extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>
As a result of many, many bad experiences, over the weekend, we'll be switching DNS providers. I asked around about quality DNS providers and I got a few consistent recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.easydns.com/">EasyDNS</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zoneedit.com/">ZoneEdit</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dyndns.com/">DynDNS</a> / <a href="http://www.dynect.com/">Dynect</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ultradns.com/">UltraDNS</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/">DNSMadeEasy</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.everydns.com/">EveryDNS</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I was also (hilariously) referred to a Server Fault question on <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/23744/hosting-your-own-dns">Hosting Your Own DNS</a>. The entire <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/tagged?tagnames=dns&sort=votes">DNS tag on Server Fault</a> is good reading as well.</p>
<p>
We eventually decided to go with <a href="http://dynamicnetworkservices.com/">Dynamic Network Services</a>.</p>
<p>

They must know DNS cold, because they have <a href="http://dyn.com/">a freaking three letter domain name</a>, man!</p>
<p>
I also got to learn the exciting intricacies of exporting DNS records to text format, including <a href="http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch8/soa.html">the thrilling Start of Authority (SOA) record</a>.</p>
<p><pre>
example.com.    IN    SOA   ns.example.com. hostmaster.example.com. (
                              2003080800 ; sn = serial number
                              172800     ; ref = refresh = 2d
                              900        ; ret = update retry = 15m
                              1209600    ; ex = expiry = 2w
                              3600       ; min = minimum = 1h
                              )
</pre>
<p>
Starting at 5 pm PST today, we'll flip over to the new nameservers:</p>
<p><pre>
ns1.p19.dynect.net
ns2.p19.dynect.net
ns3.p19.dynect.net
ns4.p19.dynect.net
</pre>
<p>
It is our hope that outsourcing our DNS to professionals -- to companies that specialize in this stuff -- will result in less unpredictability when navigating to our websites.</p>

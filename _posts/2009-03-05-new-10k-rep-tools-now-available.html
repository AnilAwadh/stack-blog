Those 10,000 reputation tools I promised, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/12/a-stack-overflow-holiday/">lo those many moons ago?</a> They are now live. If you have the requisite reputation, you'll see a link at the top of every page which leads to the tools area:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congratulations on achieving 10,000 reputation!</p>
<p>You've earned the right to see (and undelete) deleted posts, and vote to delete questions that have been closed for 2 days.</p>
<p>You also have access to these moderation tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>posts with 2 or more offensive votes</li>
<li>recently deleted posts</li>
<li>recently closed questions</li>
<li>see all recent edits in chronological order</li>
<li>new posts by new users</li>
<li>new answers to old questions</li>
<li>recent questions with most view velocity</li>
<li>recent questions with most edit velocity</li>
<li>recent questions with most vote velocity</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nothing secret here, it's all public information you can get from the website itself, for the most part, just in an easier to consume form.</p>
<p>
Yes I did say "a few days" at the end of December. 6-8 weeks, a few days, what's the difference? <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/07/podcast-16/">Which part of "six to eight weeks" didn't you understand?</a> :)</p>
<p>
These are <b>the same tools we use</b> to keep an eye on the system and make sure nothing too <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/the-great-edit-wars/">weird</a> is happening. We intend to deliver on the promise of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/about">our about page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We don't run Stack Overflow. <i>You</i> do. Stack Overflow is <b>collaboratively built and maintained by your fellow programmers</b>. Once the system learns to trust you, you'll be able to edit anything, much like Wikipedia. With your help, we can build good answers to every imaginable programming question together. No matter what programming language you use, or what operating system you call home -- better programming is our goal.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Hopefully this will help us manage the flow of incoming Q&A together. Clearly, our small team does not scale, so <b>I'm relying on you experienced Stack Overflow users to lead the way for others</b>.</p>
<p>
I am open to adding more tool pages here that make sense -- but please don't make serious requests until you've tried these pages for a while to see how they work!</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p>

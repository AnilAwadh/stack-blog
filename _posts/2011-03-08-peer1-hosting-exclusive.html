<p>In 2003, <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/">Fog Creek Software</a> (aka Joel’s other baby) moved offices, and decided to ditch its internal T1 and look for a colocation provider. Joel <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Peer1.html">was impressed</a> with PEER 1 Hosting’s customer service, the shiny new data center in NYC, and PEER 1 Hosting even volunteered to host <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a> – for free!</p>
<p>When we decided to move our Stack Exchange Network to the East Coast to <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/stack-overflow-2010-analytics/">better serve our global customers</a>, PEER 1 Hosting was the logical choice because of the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/08/21.html">success</a> that Fog Creek had. We began to migrate part of the data center in May of 2010, and finalized the move of all live sites from Oregon in <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/datacenter-migration-oct-23/">October of 2010</a>. After all the sites were set up at PEER 1 Hosting, we noticed some awesome results and thus we started a discussion with PEER 1 Hosting about how to extend the same benefits to the community.</p>
<p>We think it’s a <a href="http://www.peer1.com/stackoverflow">win-win</a>!</p>
<ul>
<li>As an advantage of being part of the community you get an <a href="http://www.peer1.com/stackoverflow">awesome data center at a discounted price</a> – Win!</li>
<li>The more business Peer 1 Hosting does with people in the community, the more support they can provide to power Stack Exchange – Win!</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a look at our servers hosted at PEER 1 Hosting:</p>

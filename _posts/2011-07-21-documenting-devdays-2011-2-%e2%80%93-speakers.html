<p>We’re excited to share an in-depth look at just some of the confirmed speakers for <a href="http://devdays.stackoverflow.com/">DevDays 2011</a>!  The program is comprised of heavy hitters on topics picked by you and the rest of the Stack Overflow community.  As Joel <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/devdays-is-back/">mentioned</a>, the purpose of DevDays is to provide a top-notch education on several technologies and these speakers certainly live up to that challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Salman Khan<br />
</strong>Sal Khan is the founder and one-man faculty of the Khan Academy (khanacademy.org), a nonprofit with the mission of providing free, high-quality education to “anyone, anywhere” in the world. A former hedge fund analyst with degrees from MIT and Harvard, Khan was helping a young cousin with math in 2004, communicating by phone and using an interactive notepad. When others expressed interest, he began posting videos of his hand-scribbled tutorials on YouTube. Demand took off, and in 2009 he quit his day job.  The Khan Academy is the most-used library of educational videos on the web, with two million unique students per month and over 50 million lessons delivered.</p>

<p><strong>Jon Skeet<br />
</strong>Jon Skeet is user 22656 on Stack Overflow, where he tends to post about C# and Java. If you want to attract his attention, post a question pointing out a situation where a C# program doesn’t behave in an expected way, citing the specification. Please don’t do so shortly before this talk though, as he’ll be very distracted until he gets a chance to dig into it.</p>
<p>In terms of coding-for-money, Jon is a software engineer at Google’s London office, currently working on the Google Offers project. He speaks in a personal capacity, however, not on behalf of Google. Except to say that Google is hiring, and any CVs should be sent directly to him.</p>

<p><strong>Michael Barker</strong></p>
<p>Michael Barker is currently a lead developer at London Multi-Asset eXchange (LMAX) where he spends most of his time scratching his head while thinking about simpler and faster solutions.</p>
<p>Intermingled with travelling to various countries around the world, Michael’s 10+ years of experience has been spent battling unnecessary complexity across a variety of industries (finance, telecoms, government) and in whatever technology that happens to have been hurled in his direction (Java/JavaEE, C++, .NET).  Michael is also a sporadic Open Source contributor having dropped patches into a number of OSS projects including PostgreSQL, JBoss, GNU Classpath and most recently Mono.</p>

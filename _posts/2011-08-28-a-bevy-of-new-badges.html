<p>The badge system exists for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>to teach new users how Stack Exchange works
</li>
<li>to <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/badges-positive-only/">encourage activities we view as positive to the community</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As the engine grows and evolves, we discover new areas that need badges.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nerdmeritbadges.com/"><img src="assets/nerd-badges.jpg" alt="" title="nerd-badges" width="600" height="152" /></a></p>
<p>In fact, we've added a bevy of new badges in the last 6 months or so that we haven't had time to talk about yet.</p>

<p>Badges are <i>supposed</i> to be a little mysterious; you should view them as minor puzzles with obvious hints.</p>
<ul>
<li>What activity is this badge referring to?
</li>
<li>How do I perform this activity?
</li>
<li>Why is this activity important and necessary?
</li>
<li>Who should normally perform this activity, and when?
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these are fairly self-explanatory, but I believe the flag weight and review sections do warrant some background. Of course there's <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/80170/what-is-flag-weight">the insanely detailed meta faq</a> about flag weight, but the short version is this: <b><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/improved-flagging/">flag things</a> that community moderators agree is helpful, and your flag weight will go up</b>.</p>
<p>Your flag weight, if it is something other than the default of 100, will be visible on your user profile under your reputation score.</p>
<p><img src="assets/flag-weight-profile.png" alt="" title="flag-weight-profile" width="164" height="182" style="border: 1px solid silver" /></p>
<p>You can view the status of your flags by clicking the flag weight link. There are two flag dispositions, <b>helpful</b> and <b>declined</b>. Generally, so long as you are flagging in a genuinely useful manner that helps make the site better, most of your flags should be of the former and not the latter.</p>
<p>If you're looking for posts to flag -- or vote, edit, and comment on -- I <i>highly</i> recommend using the review link on the site. At the top of every page you'll see one of two links: either <b>review</b> (from 200 to 9,999 reputation) or <b>tools</b> (from 10,000+ reputation and beyond). Both can get you to the review page.</p>
<p><img src="assets/review-link.png" alt="" title="review-link" width="422" height="50" /></p>
<p>Click around on the review page and read the explanation on the sidebar to get the gist of it. </p>
<p><img src="assets/review-answer-flag.png" alt="" title="review-answer-flag" width="600" height="125" style="border:1px silver solid" /></p>
<p>Please do bear in mind that <b>flagging is no substitute for the normal editing and voting process</b>. We encourage responsible flagging, but if a question should be closed, or a post downvoted, don't hesitate to take action yourself. Actions from the broader community as a whole speak much louder than actions from community moderators!</p>

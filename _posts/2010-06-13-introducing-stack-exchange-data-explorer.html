This means it belongs to <i>everyone</i>, and can be freely reused (even commercially!), so long as it is follows <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/attribution-required/">our simple rules of attribution</a>. That's our contract with the community -- it's <i>your</i> generously contributed content that makes these websites worth visiting in the first place! </p>
<p>
Thus, we <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/category/cc-wiki-dump/">provide dumps of all the public data</a> in the current Stack Exchange network (Stack Overflow, Server Fault, Super User, and Meta) every month, like clockwork.</p>
<p>
But if you just want to play with the data, it's kind of tedious: you have to download the entire 700 plus megabyte archive, import it into some kind of database system -- and only then can you even <i>begin</i> thinking about how to query out the results you're looking for.</p>
<p>
Well, I'm pleased to announce that we now officially support <b>a web tool for sharing, querying, and analyzing the Creative Commons data from every website in the Stack Exchange network</b> -- the <a href="http://odata.stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange Data Explorer</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://odata.stackexchange.com/" style="border-bottom:none"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/stack-exchange-data-explorer.png" alt="" title="stack-exchange-data-explorer" width="600" height="371" style="border:1px solid silver" /></a></p>
<p>
The Stack Exchange Data Explorer, or SEDE:</p>
<ol>
<li>provides easy web-based access to the latest and greatest monthly Stack Exchange website data dumps*
</li>
<li>gives us an <a href="http://www.odata.org/">Open Data Protocol</a> (odata) endpoint
</li>
<li>allows testing, running, editing and <i>permalinking</i> to public queries against our corpus of data with a simple, syntax-highlighted web UI
</li>
<li>can be used as a permanently linkable tool for teaching general SQL and relational database concepts -- we can be our own <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa276825(SQL.80).aspx">Northwind</a> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa238305(SQL.80).aspx">Pubs</a> database, when answering questions tagged [sql]!
</li>
<li>hosted on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/windowsazure/">Windows Azure</a> so it's speedy, scalable, and always available (and did I mention, generously sponsored by Microsoft?)
</li>
<li>built from the same ASP.NET MVC software stack as our own engine, and will be open-sourced so others can learn from the code
</li>
</ol>
<p>
We've been working with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/17174/sam-saffron">Sam Saffron</a> to build this out, and even though this is only a public beta, it's already amazing! But don't take my word for it -- check out the <b>Stack Exchange Data Explorer</b> yourself at ...</p>
<p><h2><a href="http://odata.stackexchange.com/">http://odata.stackexchange.com</a></h2>
<p>
... and leave any beta feedback <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/data-explorer">in the [data-explorer] tag on meta</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>The ultimate goal of all of our sites is learning, and making the Internet a <i>slightly</i> better place.</b> I believe the SEDE achieves both of these goals in a rather serendipitous way -- it helps us teach SQL and relational databases by querying the very posts we're creating as we teach! Yes, maybe it's a little geeky, but it is magical to me.</p>
<p>
<sub>* we are looking at eventually making special weekly or biweekly dumps for SEDE</sub></p>

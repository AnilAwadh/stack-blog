The <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/logo-design-contest-for-superuser-com/">logo design contest for superuser.com</a> is now complete.</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/superuser-com-logo-vote/">voting results</a> helped inform our final decision:</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.pollsb.com/polls/p2131264-logo_works_best_superuser_com#results" style="border-bottom:none"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/superuser-voting-results.png" alt="superuser-voting-results" title="superuser-voting-results" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>
At the time that screenshot was taken, we had 2,303 votes -- but the relative percentages were remarkably stable over time. Two clear leaders.</p>
<p>
The final winner we decided on was <a href="http://www.crowdspring.com/myspring/profile/Mogeek">Mogeek</a>, with <a href="http://www.crowdspring.com/projects/graphic_design/logo/logo_for_superuser_com/gallery/6__1">entry #425</a> (a late entry!). What I liked about this logo is its simplicity, while simultaneously referencing both the classic Mac OS "face" icon, and old-school ASCII art. This entry was <i>consistently</i> cited by my designery pals (and even Joel himself) as one they liked. First prize is worth <b>$768</b> or 2<sup>9</sup> + 2<sup>8</sup>. Congratulations to Mogeek!</p>

Nathanial Dicke</a>. He also wins <b>$200</b>. (This was one of my favorites.)</p>

<p>
A special honorable mention goes out to these entries by <a href="http://www.crowdspring.com/projects/graphic_design/logo/logo_for_superuser_com/gallery/superuser__99">Raul Padilla</a>, <a href="http://www.crowdspring.com/projects/graphic_design/logo/logo_for_superuser_com/gallery/superuser__16">haim</a>, and <a href="http://www.crowdspring.com/projects/graphic_design/logo/logo_for_superuser_com/gallery/03">mfourex</a>. It was a tough call.</p>
<p>
Thanks to everyone who took the time to submit an entry!</p>
<p>
Now that we've got a logo and color scheme, the <b>superuser.com private beta should begin sometime the month</b>, and any Stack Overflow or Server Fault user with reputation of 200 or more is invited!</p>

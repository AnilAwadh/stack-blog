<p>In December we launched the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/stack-overflow-annual-survey/">Stack Overflow Annual User Survey</a> in order to measure the user demographics that Google Analytics can’t provide us with. Finding out the user demographics became necessary due to the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/stack-overflow-2010-analytics/">growth that Stack Overflow had in 2010</a>.</p>
<p>Of the 2,813 surveys started, 2,532 were completed, for a completion rate of 90%!  Thank you to everyone who participated.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/sr.aspx?sm=QpfonhAfJ6Q_2b96IzwzwYHG8rRP95fT_2fNNAWjvnLWTzw_3d" target="_blank">View a report of the survey results</a></h2>
<p>Or if you’d like to do your own analysis you can <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/#folders/0BwIexitMAu8ceG95UUkyUGlRM0U">download the survey results</a>.</p>
<p>Now, for some interesting facts ripped from the headlines:</p>
<p><strong>Job Satisfaction<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/01/it-poll-how-satisfied-are-you.php">ReadWriteWeb reported</a> that according to a Gartner analyst, more than 1/3 of IT professionals are interested in switching jobs.</p>
<p>According to our poll, users were slightly more satisfied with 31.6% of respondents indicating job satisfaction of “FML”, “I’m not happy in my job”, and “It pays the bills”. On a good note, the remaining 68.4% of respondents were satisfied with their jobs responding “So happy it hurts” and “I enjoy going to work”.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Phone Wars<br />
</strong><a href="http://androidcommunity.com/android-beats-iphone-in-number-of-total-users-for-first-time-20110107/">The Android community reported</a> on January 7 that in of all US Smartphone Subscribers in November 2010, 26% used Android, 25% iPhone, and majority 33.5% BlackBerry. November 2010 marked the first month that Android beat the iPhone in total number of users.</p>
<p>Our results looked slightly different, with iPhone and Android having the biggest pieces of the pie. In fact, iPhone beat out Android by about 4 percentage points -- 34.3% iPhone and 30.4% Android. BlackBerry use within our community came in at dead last with 6.9% of users, a drastic contrast from the majority 33.5% of all smartphone subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>Start-Ups<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.observer.com/2010/media/nyc-startups-desperately-seeking-technical-talent">Especially in New York City, technical positions are in high demand at start-ups.</a> In our survey, the majority of the respondents, 28.2%, work at a start-up – classified by us as 1-25 employees. Of those working at a start-up, the projects and job roles varied from the overall average. Web Application Developer was still the most popular job role, but by an even larger margin.  50.6% of those in start-ups work as a Web Application Developer as compared to 40.3% on average.  Web platform is still the leading development project, but also at a larger percentage for start-ups -- 41.8% as compared to the average 33.3%.</p>

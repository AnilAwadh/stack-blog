Joel and I will be at the upcoming <a href="http://2009.visitmix.com/">MIX 09</a> conference in Las Vegas next week.</p>

<p>
More specifically, <b>we'll be doing the Stack Overflow podcast <i>live</i> from the show!</b></p>
<p>
<b>Tuesday, March 17</b>, 2009, at <b>6:30 PM</b><br />
At the <b>Third Place</b> hang out area<br />
The Venetian Las Vegas<br />
4th Floor, Marcelo 4403</p>
<p>
<font color="red">You <i>will</i> need to be registered for the conference</font> (which takes place at the Venetian). You do <i>not</i> need to be registered for the workshops.</p>
<p>
This is technically the day before the conference begins, but if you'll be there, do stop by! I know Joel is bringing all kinds of crazy audio equipment for lots of audience participation.</p>
<p>
<b>Geoff Dalgas and Jarrod Dixon from the Stack Overflow team will also be present for the duration of the conference</b>, so if you spy them walking around the Venetian, feel free to strike up a conversation with them and grill them on any aspect of SO. I grant anyone reading this full permission to monopolize their time. :)</p>
<p>
If you can't attend the conference, as a perk for those viewing remotely over the web, there's also a <a href="http://visitmix.com/News/Watch-MIX-Online-Ask-the-Gu">brief 30 minute online-only Q&A after the keynote</a> with Scott Guthrie (aka "The Gu") and myself. I believe we'll be taking questions through the Twitter #askthegu hashtag. And with any luck I'll have nothing to say because the Gu has more programming knowledge in the tip of his pinky finger than I have in my entire body.</p>

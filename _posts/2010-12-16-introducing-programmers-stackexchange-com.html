<p>One of the <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">more popular Stack Exchange beta sites</a> just came out of beta with a final public design:</p>
<h2><a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com">programmers.stackexchange.com</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/programmers-stackexchange1.png" alt="" title="programmers-stackexchange" width="600" height="390" /></a></p>
<p>Now watch closely as I read your mind.</p>
<h2>I don't get it! What's the difference between Programmers and Stack Overflow?</h2>
<p>I'm so glad you asked!</p>
<p>In a nutshell, <b style="background-color:#FFFBCC">Stack Overflow is for when you're front of your compiler or editor</b> working through code issues. <b style="background-color:#FFFBCC">Programmers is for when you're in front of a whiteboard</b> working through higher level conceptual programming issues. <i>Hence the (awesome) whiteboard inspired design!</i></p>
<p>Stated another way, Stack Overflow questions almost all have <b style="background-color:#FFFBCC">actual source code in the questions or answers</b>. It's much rarer (though certainly OK) for a Programmers question to contain source code.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/whiteboard-code.jpg" alt="" title="whiteboard-code" width="512" height="384" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6398" /></p>
<p>Remember, these are just guidelines, not hard and fast arbitrary rules; refer to the <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic">first few paragraphs of the FAQ</a> if you want specifics about what Programmers is for:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Programmers - Stack Exchange is for expert programmers who are interested in subjective discussions on software development.</p>
<p>This can include topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software engineering
</li>
<li>Developer testing
</li>
<li>Algorithm and data structure concepts
</li>
<li>Design patterns
</li>
<li>Architecture
</li>
<li>Development methodologies
</li>
<li>Quality assurance
</li>
<li>Software law
</li>
<li>Freelancing and business concerns
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div style="background-color:#FFFBCC"><i>Editorial note: the FAQ guidance has changed significantly over the years to better reflect the sorts of conceptual questions that actually <b>work</b> - please refer to <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic">the latest version in the help center</a> before asking.</i></div>
<p>Although I fully supported this site when it was just <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/3352/not-programming-related">a baby Area 51 site proposal</a>, we've endured a lot of angst over it -- mainly because <b>it veered so heavily into the realm of the subjective</b>. It forced us to think deeply about what makes a <i>useful</i> subjective question, which we formalized into a set of 6 guidelines in <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/">Good Subjective, Bad Subjective</a>. Constructive subjective questions &hellip;</p>
<ol>
<li>inspire answers that explain “why” and “how”.</li>
<li>tend to have long, not short, answers.</li>
<li>have a constructive, fair, and impartial tone.</li>
<li>invite sharing experiences over opinions.</li>
<li>insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references.</li>
<li>are more than just mindless social fun.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, with a little extra discipline and moderation, I think the site turned out great. So, go forth and ask your <b>high level, conceptual, software development questions</b> on <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com">programmers.stackexchange.com</a>! Just make sure they're <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective">professional and constructive</a>, please - refer to <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic">help center</a> for more guidance there.</p>

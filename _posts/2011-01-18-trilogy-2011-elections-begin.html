<p>After <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/stack-exchange-moderator-elections-begin/">vetting the new, improved election process on math.stackexchange.com</a> we're ready for the next big step: <b>2011 community moderator elections on Stack Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User.</b></p>
<p>If you've ever thought to yourself, "Hey, <i>I'd</i> make a great community moderator!" -- now is your chance to nominate yourself:</p>
<h2><a href="http://serverfault.com/election">serverfault.com/election</a></h2>
<h2><a href="http://superuser.com/election">superuser.com/election</a></h2>
<h2><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/election">stackoverflow.com/election</a><br />
</h2>
<p>Don't worry -- all our excellent community moderators on the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/">trilogy</a> will carry on as moderators. It's only on new Stack Exchange 2.0 sites with <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/">Pro Tem Moderators</a> that existing moderators must run in the first election to continue their terms.</p>

<p>The community moderator election process is documented on the individual election pages in great detail, but in brief, here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Nominations</b> -- seven days<br />
In the nomination phase, any community member in good standing with at least <b>2000</b> (<b>3000</b> on Stack Overflow) reputation may nominate themselves -- and <i>only</i> themselves -- as a candidate in the moderator election. Nominations require writing a brief introduction explaining to the greater community why the candidate would make a good community moderator. Comments are encouraged in this phase, along with plenty of editing to make the introduction better, but there is no voting. The top <b>30</b> nominees (ordered by reputation) proceed to the primary phase unless they opt to withdraw.</p>
<p>Note: If there are <b>10</b> or less candidates at the end of this phase, we skip directly to Election. </p>
</li>
<li><b>Primary</b> -- four days<br />
In the primary phase, all community members with at least <b>150</b> reputation can cast an up or down vote on each candidate, resulting in a public tally. No comments are allowed in the primary; any opinions on the suitability of each candidate should be expressed as a simple up or down primary vote. The top <b>10</b> candidates by score will proceed on to the election phase, unless they opt to withdraw. </p>
</li>
<li><b>Election</b> -- four days<br />
Once the election begins, there will be per-user site notifications to all eligible voters. In the election phase, all community members with at least <b>150</b> reputation can cast three votes: 1st choice, 2nd choice, and 3rd choice. All votes are private until the election is complete, at which point the election data file (the vote totals for all the candidates; no identification of who voted for whom) will be freely and permanently downloadable by anyone. We will calculate the winners using <a href="http://www.openstv.org/">OpenSTV</a> and the Meek STV method.
</li>
</ol>
<p>In a little over two weeks, the election process should hopefully produce <b>several new democratically elected community moderators!</b> </p>
<p>Democracy only works when the community participates, so if you know someone who would make a great community moderator, urge them to nominate themselves. And as always, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/">please vote!</a></p>

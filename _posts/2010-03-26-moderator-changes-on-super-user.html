I'd like to announce a changing of the guard for <a href="http://superuser.com">Super User</a> moderation.</p>
<p>
First, let's extend a hearty welcome to our two new Super User moderators:</p>
<p>
<iframe src="http://superuser.com/users/flair/307.html" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="210" height="60"></iframe></p>
<p>
<iframe src="http://superuser.com/users/flair/12786.html" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="210" height="60"></iframe></p>
<p>
Welcome <a href="http://superuser.com/users/307/random">random</a> and <a href="http://superuser.com/users/12786/quack-quixote">quack quixote</a> (nee ~quack) as our newest <b>Super User community moderators!</b> They both come highly recommended, not just by me, but by their peers in <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/43378/should-random-be-elected-a-moderator-on-super-user">this meta nomination thread</a>.</p>
<p>
In related news, <a href="http://superuser.com/users/3981/diago">Diago</a> has indicated he'd like to step down as a moderator. Thanks, Diago, for everything you've done so far -- you had arguably the most difficult moderator position with the least support from us (which was <i>totally</i> our fault; a mistake I hope not to repeat) and you did an excellent job regardless. I completely understand and support the decision to take a break from moderating. You are welcome back as a moderator any time on my watch.</p>
<p>
As always, I recommend that new moderators (or anyone interested in the topic) read through <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/">A Theory of Moderation</a> -- also, keep an eye on the following meta tags for discussion about what moderators should (or shouldn't) be doing on the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/">Trilogy</a>:</p>
<p>
<a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/moderation">moderation</a>, <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/moderators">moderators</a>, <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/moderator-abilities">moderator-abilities</a></p>
<p>
While some moderation topics are inherently a private matter between users, <b>we try to discuss as much of it in public as possible</b>. We have a reasonable set of moderation guidelines, but how we moderate continues to evolve -- and will hopefully <i>improve</i> as we bring in new community moderators with new perspectives and new ideas.</p>
<p /></p></p></p>

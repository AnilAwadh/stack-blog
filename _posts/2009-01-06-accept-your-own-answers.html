Have you ever wondered <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/11/why-cant-i-accept-my-own-answer/">why you can't accept your own answer</a> on Stack Overflow? If so, you're <a href="http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/pages/general/suggestions/39426-allow-users-to-accept-their-own-answers-with-no-rep-gain">not alone</a>.</p>
<p>
As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words; here's what I just did to one of my own questions:</p>
<p>
<b>Before:</b></p>
<hr />
<p>
<img src="assets/accept-own-answer-before.png" alt="accept-own-answer-before" title="accept-own-answer-before" /></p>
<p>
<b>After:</b></p>
<hr />
<p>
<img src="assets/accept-own-answer-after.png" alt="accept-own-answer-after" title="accept-own-answer-after" /></p>
<p>
Hey, look at that, I just <b>accepted my own answer!</b></p>
<p>
Now, there are some special rules around owner-accepted answers, to prevent gaming:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Wait 48 hours.</b> You must wait 2 days from the time you originally asked your question before you can accept your own answer. This gives other users a chance to answer the question in good faith, and earn the accepted answer.
</li>
<li><b>No change in sort order</b>. Normally, accepted answers are "docked" under the question. This is not true for owner accepted answers; they stay in standard sort order like any other answer.
</li>
<li><b>No reputation is earned</b>. Normally, accepted answers confer +15 rep to the answerer and +2 to the owner.  Owner accepted answers do not earn rep (or badges) for anyone.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I was initially very much against this, but several commenters in the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/11/why-cant-i-accept-my-own-answer/">Why Can't I Accept My Own Answer?</a> post convinced me that, with a few rule tweaks, it <i>could</i> work. As you can see on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8681/jquery-validate-failure-in-opera">a question I myself asked</a>, sometimes you really have no other option than to close the loop yourself, and it's nice to be able to do so by accepting your own answer.</p>
<p>
Enjoy! Oh, and you can thank Jarrod for implementing this one so quickly on his <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/welcome-stack-overflow-employee-00002/">first day on the job</a>. Kudos.</p>

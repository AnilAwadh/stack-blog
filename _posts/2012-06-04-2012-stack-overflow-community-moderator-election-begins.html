<p>Hard to believe it's been only six months since the last moderator election on Stack Overflow...</p>
<p>Remember <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/">A Theory of Moderation</a>? It talks about how moderators are the "human exception handlers" on Stack Overflow, elected to deal with those rare situations the normal community moderation can't handle. It also notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most common moderator task is to follow up on <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/improved-flagging/">flagged posts</a>. Every post contains a small <strong>flag link</strong>, which anyone with 15 reputation can use.</p></blockquote>
<p>Over 200K users with at least 15 reputation have accessed Stack Overflow in the past three months. That's a lot of folks able to <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/raising-a-red-flag/">raise a red flag</a> - and a lot of them <em>do</em>.</p>
<p>With 12 moderators on Stack Overflow, handling the more than 1,300 flags each day has become an increasingly heavy load to bear - so we're looking for a few good men or women willing to step up and help. If you're an experienced, community-minded member of Stack Overflow, willing to devote a bit of time each day to assisting your comrades, visit <strong><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/election">http://stackoverflow.com/election</a> </strong>and nominate yourself.</p>
<p>Of course, needing more moderators is <em>a good problem to have</em> - it means Stack Overflow is thriving, its community able to recognize when a something on the site needs attention. That said, there's something a bit wrong with this many flags going to the exception handlers, when many of them can and should be handled by other <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/new-10k-rep-tools-now-available/">trusted members</a> of the community. Last fall we started experimenting with ways of presenting <em>some</em> flags - those most likely to require actions available to ordinary users - to the 10K users first, and forward them only to moderators when unresolved in a reasonable period of time. We'll be expanding this in the next month to put <em>flagging</em> for action (close, delete, re-open, etc.) and <em>voting</em> for action in the same league when it comes to requiring moderator intervention. Stay tuned...</p>

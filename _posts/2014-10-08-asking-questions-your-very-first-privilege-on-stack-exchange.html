<p>Folks often speak of how much fun it is to earn reputation and badges while participating on our sites, and they're not wrong! However, one of the single most innovative things our engine has brought to the world of Q&A is a system of trust based on the merits of your previous contributions. While there are some things that you can do immediately, we reserve most advanced features for those that have a track record for making our sites better than they were.</p>
<p>Asking questions on our sites <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/"><em>is</em> a privilege, <em>not</em> a right</a>. In order to keep that privilege, your contributions <em>must</em> improve upon, or at least not detract from, the quality of the resource that your community provides. Asking good questions is also one of the <em>hardest</em> aspects of participating on our sites for new users to master, so we've made some significant improvements in the ways that we help folks learn how to do it.</p>
<h3>We much more quickly communicate that asking <em>is</em> a privilege.</h3>
<p>Your ability to ask questions <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/asking-rate-limited">is now completely commensurate</a> with how well your recent questions have been received, how diligently you've worked to improve upon your past contributions, and how well you've worked to participate in other ways on the site.</p>
<p>This wasn't immediately obvious to many people because they didn't have to accomplish anything in order to <em>earn</em> the privilege to ask questions &mdash; they could do it right away. If your first couple of questions haven't been very well-received, the system now slows you down a little at first, tells you why you should wait a bit, and gives much better guidance on what to do with the time.</p>
<h3>We better recognize that asking <em>is</em> hard for many new users.</h3>
<p>Rather than waiting until someone has <em>already asked</em> a few ill-received questions before preventing them from asking more, we now intercede much faster. Additionally, not all questions <em>can</em> be improved to the point that they receive a better score; we now give you more credit for trying, and more chances to get it right.</p>
<p>The system can ask you to wait for a period between 1 and 7 days, depending on what you've done recently. Some users will never encounter a limit, some users might encounter it several times before getting the hang of things. The point is, you have more chances to <em>fix</em> past mistakes,  and more chances to <em>avoid</em> them going forward.</p>
<h3>As much as we want to, we can't be the best fit for everyone.</h3>
<p>Every new community that we launch defines an audience that they cater to; on Stack Overflow it's programmers and programming enthusiasts. While the word "enthusiast" has always been a bit open-ended, the community expects those that have questions to be able to express them clearly and succinctly. Basic questions are always welcome, they just need to be understandable, and not already covered thoroughly elsewhere on the site.</p>
<p>There are some folks that simply aren't far along enough within a topic to be able to ask good questions to a very specific audience, and that's okay &mdash; learning is a process that varies for everyone.</p>
<p>We will still decline to accept questions from accounts that just couldn't manage to get the hang of things after quite a few attempts, but the block doesn't last forever. It may take months or more, but the system <em>will</em> eventually give users the benefit of the doubt in conjunction with another chance. Positive participation in other areas will definitely expedite this process.</p>
<h3>This is a piece in a much larger system</h3>
<p>The new rate limits have been tested thoroughly on several of our larger sites, and will soon be turned on network-wide.</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/se-quality-project">quality initiative</a> has even more features on the way that are designed to give users that can benefit from it a little extra help, while ensuring that the quality of our resources remains the best that you can find. Keep checking back, we've got even more exciting things on the way!

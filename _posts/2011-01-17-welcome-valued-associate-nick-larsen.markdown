2011 is starting off with a bang! I'm excited to announce that [Nick Larsen](http://stackoverflow.com/users/178082/nicklarsen) has joined the Stack Overflow team in our NYC headquarters.

Nick relocated from Atlanta, GA with his lovely wife Mary Paige, a graphic designer, and their rescued dachshund Maddy, a nap enthusiast. They're settling into their new apartment on the Upper East Side conveniently located near the “small dog” park and a tequila bar. As if this isn’t enough to keep him busy, Nick also builds and launches high power rockets.

As part of the [Stack Overflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/) programming team, Nick is working to take the user experience to the next level.

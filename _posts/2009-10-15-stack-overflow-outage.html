Our apologies for the all-site outage today. According to our Pingdom monitors, we were down from <b>7:18 PM PST to 9:43 PM PST</b>. There goes our vaunted envy-of-the-industry three nines uptime guarantee! </p>
<p>
Apparently there was a router meltdown at our ISP, <a href="http://www.peakinternet.com/business/hosting/colocation-dedicated#">Peak Internet</a>. They promised pictures of the (literally?) melted router via an <a href="http://twitter.com/PEAKInternet/status/4908010791">update on their Twitter account</a>. If they come through, I'll post the pictures here for our viewing pleasure.</p>

<p>
(not as dramatic as I had hoped, but there are some definite scorch marks around that solder!)</p>
<p>
At any rate, if you guys and gals could send a few less fiery packets of network doom to our ISP's routers, we'd appreciate it. </p>

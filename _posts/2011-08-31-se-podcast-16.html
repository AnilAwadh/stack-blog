<p>So it's been a couple weeks since our last podcast, but Jeff &amp; Joel are back and ready to catch up on everything they missed.  There's no guest this week, just 60+ minutes of that Jeff &amp; Joel banter that (we hope) you've grown to love.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jeff and Joel discuss “Zombie Poke,” aka <a href="http://facebook.stackoverflow.com">facebook.stackoverflow.com</a> deal in depth and dispel rumors of receiving a “dump truck of money.” <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/facebook-stackoverflow/">Details of the deal</a> are discussed, from what the new feature accomplishes and how it came about.</li>
<li>Jeff also discusses the state of online identity and the issues that arise with having multiple logins.</li>
<li>Joel explains why he thinks Facebook might be the new AOL.</li>
<li>Jeff relays a story about a Stack Exchange user who devised a clever way to get his dad involved in the <a href="http://bicycles.stackexchange.com">Bicycles Stack Exchange</a>. Joel wonders if this, or something similar, should be undertaken by CHAOS.</li>
<li>The duo discusses which Stack Exchange sites don’t meet their personal expectations. The hit list includes Super User, Writing, and Gaming. Jeff goes into depth about his issues with <a href="http://gaming.stackexchange.com">Gaming.SE</a>, even though it's the fifth most trafficked site.</li>
<li>Joel talks about the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/reputation-not-rep/">myth that reputation</a> affects programmers’ career opportunities.</li>
<li>A question from the chat room about the Publicist badge spurs discussion about sharing questions on the internet and how it relates to Stack Overflow.</li>
<li>We discuss <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/">the state of Community Wiki</a>. If you're looking for a good example of a community wiki <i>answer</i>, look no further than <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/231977/how-do-i-diagnose-not-being-able-to-reach-a-specific-website-as-an-end-user/231980#231980">How do I diagnose not being able to reach a specific website as an end user?</a>
	</li>
<li>And of course, if you enjoy the Stack Exchange podcast, make sure to check out the <a href="http://podcast.askdifferent.net/">Ask Different Podcast</a> - hosted by our <a href="http://www.askdifferent.com">Ask Different </a>(aka apple.stackexchange) moderators!</li>
</ul>
<p>We're back on our regular schedule now, so tune in next week for another great episode!</p>

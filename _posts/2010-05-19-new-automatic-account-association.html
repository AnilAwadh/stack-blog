<p>
We're bringing back a feature we had to <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/googles-openids-are-unique-per-domain/">put on ice</a> way back when we launched Server Fault*: <b>automatic account association</b>. Due largely to the vagaries of how Google implemented OpenID, we reluctantly made <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/cross-site-account-associations/">account association a manual process</a>.</p>
<p>
But not any more. As <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/openid-one-year-later/">OpenID has matured</a>, we've figured out a way to make it happen. So as of today, whenever you log in to any site in our network, which is currently...</p>
<ul>
<li>Stack Overflow
</li>
<li>Server Fault
</li>
<li>Super User
</li>
<li>Meta Stack Overflow
</li>
</ul>
<p>
... we will <b><i>automatically</i> find any related accounts you have on <i>any</i> site in our network, and associate them with your account.</b> The only thing you need to do for this to work, is log in using the same OpenID on each site.</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/auto-association.png" alt="" title="auto-association" width="600" height="308" style="border:1px solid silver" /></p>
<p>
But wait! There's more!</p>
<p>
At new user login time, in addition to association, we also:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grant you a <b>+100</b> reputation bonus on the <i>current</i> site, as long as you have at least <b>+200</b> reputation on <i>any</i> site in our network. So you're not treated like a newbie on every new site we launch.
</li>
<li>Copies your profile from the network site where you have the <i>highest</i> reputation, to the current site.
</li>
<li>Locate any of <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/migrate-questions-between-websites/">your questions that were migrated to this site</a> and make you own them again. It was impossible for you to own them prior to this point, because you didn't even <i>have</i> an account on the current site!
</li>
</ol>
<p>
None of the above is truly new, but it is now fully automatic at login time. And we're not taking away manual control, either -- you can still associate and de-associate manually via the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/cross-site-account-associations/">accounts tab on your user page</a>, as before.</p>
<p>
As you might imagine, this sort of "identity that follows me from website to website" becomes more and more important as we launch more sites in our network -- <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/post/518474918/stack-exchange-2-0">as planned with Stack Exchange 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>
* <sub>no, I haven't forgotten it's almost the one year anniversary of <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/server-fault-public-beta-launches/">Server Fault going public</a>. We have something very special planned, so stay tuned...</sub></p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p>

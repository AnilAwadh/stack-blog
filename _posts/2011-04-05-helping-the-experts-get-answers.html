<p>In <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/a-recipe-to-promote-your-site/">A Recipe to Promote your Site</a>, Robert provided a great set of guidelines for organically growing your Q&A community. Buried within was this observation:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Reach the right kind of publications and bloggers. Make sure that the key experts in every field know about the site; not just the “Martha Stewart” big names; we want to talk to the people who go to these conferences.
</p></blockquote>
<p>But <i>how</i> do you reach writers, bloggers, and other notable experts in the field?</p>
<p><b>Help them get answers to their questions, too!</b> </p>
<p>I've had the privilege of meeting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Bray">Tim Bray</a> once in real life <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/01/see-you-at-cusec-2008.html">at CUSEC '08</a>. I wouldn't say he is a friend, per se, but he is certainly someone I admire and respect -- and he is a notable expert on a number of topics.</p>
<p>So when I saw Tim <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/timbray/status/53139383058051072">posit this question on Twitter</a> ...</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/timbray/status/53139383058051072"><img src="assets/tim-bray-tweet.png" alt="" title="tim-bray-tweet" width="515" height="227" style="border: 1px solid silver" /></a></p>
<p>... I said to myself, <i>hey, there's a site for that!</i></p>
<p>Since I like Tim, and I genuinely want to help him get an answer to his question, I <a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11100/getting-a-graphic-on-the-clipboard-to-disk">asked the question on his behalf</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11100/getting-a-graphic-on-the-clipboard-to-disk"><img src="assets/apple-bray-post.png" alt="" title="apple-bray-post" width="466" height="269" /></a></p>
<p>Amazingly, even without any promotion, <b>this question was answered in six minutes flat</b> -- correctly! The timestamps don't lie.  (Yes, I did subsequently <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/codinghorror/status/53142579574874112">retweet the question</a> to give it more attention, but my tweet was after the first answer arrived.)</p>
<p>By the time Tim saw "his" question, it was already answered, excellently! <b>What better way could there be to introduce an expert to your community than presenting them with an immediate answer to their question?</b> Every Q&A community we operate is predicated on this simple idea of paying it forward, of peers helping other peers learn together.</p>
<p><span style="background-color:#FFFBCC">If you want to attract notable experts to your site, don't ask what they can do for you -- <i>ask what you can do for them:</i></span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Ask great questions on their behalf</b>. If they write a blog entry or mention something (on their blog, twitter, or facebook) that contains a question -- actual or implied -- post it as a question! Do what you can to promote it, then wait and see what kind of response it gets. Edit the answers, as I did, to make them exemplary. Then bring it to their attention. <i>"I thought you brought up a great question, and it got some interesting answers here {question link}."</i>
</li>
<li><b>Invite them to weigh in on 'best of' interesting questions</b>. Pick a really interesting question, perhaps from the 'week' or 'month' tab, and appeal to their authority for a definitive expert answer. <i>"We're not sure how to answer {question link}, do you have any advice for us?"</i>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to be absolutely crystal clear that you should <i>only</i> do this because you genuinely admire this person, and honestly want to help them -- otherwise, why would you be <s>stalking</s>following them on Twitter or Facebook, or reading their blog?</p>
<p>If you want someone to go out of their way to help you, <i>go out of your way to help them first</i>. </p>

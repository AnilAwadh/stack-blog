<p dir="ltr">A few months ago, we rolled out <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/12/a-new-top-bar-for-stack-exchange/">a new top bar</a> for all of the Stack Exchange communities. The mission was consistency: Every community gets the same Stack Exchange brand at the top, the same navigation between sites, and the same live updates about new inbox items and reputation changes</p>
<p dir="ltr">But we realize that not everybody uses Stack Exchange the same way. Some people focus on one community, others participate in several, and more than a few spend a lot of time lurking now that we have <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">116 different sites</a> to choose from.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s why, <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/215928/custom-ordering-for-stack-exchange-all-sites-dropdown">as promised</a>, we have made the “Your communities” section of the Stack Exchange drop-down <strong>fully customizable</strong> so you can keep all of your favorite communities right at the top.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone" alt="Edit link" src="assets/Jbt2w.png" width="389" height="432" /></p>
<h2>Here’s how it works:</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Customizing this list is completely optional. If you do nothing, you will keep the defaults: your top five communities by reputation.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Edit mode" src="assets/69r4y.png" width="361" height="257" align="right" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">But click the edit button and the default rules no longer apply. Instead, you can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a community to the list by typing the name and clicking Add</li>
<li>Repeat #1 to add as many as you want</li>
<li>Change the order of communities in the list by clicking and dragging</li>
<li>Click the Save button to apply your changes!</li>
</ol>
<p><br clear="all" /></p>
<p>You can reset the list to the default at any time, so try it out! Then drop by <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/215928/custom-ordering-for-stack-exchange-all-sites-dropdown">the Meta post</a> to share your thoughts and feedback.</p>

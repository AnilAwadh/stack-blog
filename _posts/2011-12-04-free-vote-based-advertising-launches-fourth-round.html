<p>For almost two years, we've reached out to our programmer communities to support open-source projects.</p>
<p><a title="Permanent Link to Free Vote-Based Advertising for  Open Source Projects" href="../2009/12/free-vote-based-advertising-for-open-source-projects/" rel="bookmark">Free Vote-Based Advertising for Open Source Projects</a></p>
<p>It's time once again to <strong>publicize your favorite open-source projects in need of programmer assistance</strong>. Every six months, we accept new submissions for free open-sourced advertising to be served in an ad slot on Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>The program is simple: Create a 220 pixels by 250 pixel image ad and submit it to the <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/114442/open-source-advertising-sidebar-1h-2012">Open Source Advertising - Sidebar</a>. If it receives at least 6 votes, it will be served up to the community! The rules are listed on the site, so please read them carefully before submitting.</p>
<h2><a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/114442/open-source-advertising-sidebar-1h-2012">Submit your ad and vote here!</a></h2>
<p>Then, visit the <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/ossads/all">ad summary page</a> and mouse-over the ‘view stats’ link to see how each ad is doing.</p>
<p>Congratulations to ELMAH and JS Studio for earning the top votes in the last round!</p>
<p><a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/93322/98786"><img class="alignnone" title="ELMAH" src="assets/Wi329.png" alt="" width="220" height="250" /></a>     <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/93369/98786"><img class="alignnone" title="JS Studio" src="assets/RQJwt.png" alt="" width="220" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next round has already begun, so drop by our <a title="Graphic Design Stack Exchange" href="http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/">Graphic Design site</a> and brush up on your image manipulation and illustrator skills. There are a lot of open source projects that need your help to bring them some much-needed publicity!</p>
<p>And don't forget to come back often and vote for the newest entries.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/careers-2-0-launches/">When we launched Careers 2.0 back in 2011</a>, we set out with a goal: make the job search process better for the millions of programmers who visit our site every month. Part of achieving this goal is educating employers about what <em>you</em> want from them. In the past, our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/01/2012-stack-overflow-user-survey-results/">annual user survey</a> helped us help companies change the way they found and hired programmers, while <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Gets-Things-Done-Technical/dp/1590598385">Joel’s book on how to find the best technical talent</a> and his talk on <a href="http://www.ereexpo.com/2012spring/speakers/3993/">how to stand out and attract top talent</a> are a few other examples of how we've worked to educate tech companies on what you really want. </p>
<p>Today, we’re taking this one step further:</p>

<p>Employers are having a really hard time getting programmers to work for them &mdash; hardly a day goes by without another article, blog post or Tweet attesting to this. A study last year found that as many as <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/13/it-skills-gap-study_n_1341385.html">93% of employers</a> find a disparity between the technical skills required and the level of the talent they’re able to find while recruiting. As a result, talented programmers are in incredibly high demand, putting you in a position to demand the best jobs, perks, and benefits. </p>
<p>In the <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/resources">Employer Resource Center</a>, we offer advice on best practices, recruitment news and trends, case studies and product guides to help employers with developer hiring. We’ll be updating the content regularly (mostly via the new <a href="http://blog.careers.stackoverflow.com/">Careers 2.0 blog</a>), so check back often! If you have any tips you think employers should know about hiring developers, please leave a note in the comments below. </p>

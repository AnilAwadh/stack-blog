We just rolled out three new badges to encourage **sharing worthy questions**:

<table >
<tr >
<td valign="top" >![announcer badge (bronze)](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/announcer-badge.png)
</td>
<td valign="top" >Shared a link to a question that was visited by **25** unique IP addresses in **3** days
</td></tr>
<tr >
<td valign="top" >![booster badge (silver)](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/booster-badge.png)
</td>
<td valign="top" >Shared a link to a question that was visited by **300** unique IP addresses in **4** days
</td></tr>
<tr >
<td valign="top" >![publicist badge (gold)](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/publicist-badge.png)
</td>
<td valign="top" >Shared a link to a question that was visited by **1,000** unique IP addresses in **5** days
</td></tr>
</table>

Each badge can be earned only once, and each must be earned on a different question. Also, the tracked IPs must originate from outside our existing network.

So how do you share questions? I mentioned [in an earlier post](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/a-recipe-to-promote-your-site/) that we support a shorter URL form specifically for sharing:

`http://diy.stackexchange.com/q/970/123`

You can access the shorter URL form using the **twitter** and **facebook** sharing icons on public beta sites, or by right-clicking and copying the **link** conveniently provided under each question, on any site:

![](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/short-permalink-to-this-question.png)

To encourage this sort of sharing, there's a certain tiny percent chance a little reminder will appear on recent hot questions, or when upvoting questions that have reached a certain vote threshold:

![](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/share-a-link-to-this-hot-question.png)

Don't worry -- these reminders are _very_ infrequent by design, and limited to public betas only. They also go away forever if you hold one of the badges.

The goal here is to give everyone convenient and fun tools to _share the awesomeness_. As we said in [A Recipe to Promote your Site](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/a-recipe-to-promote-your-site/):



<blockquote>
The absolute best and easiest way to promote your site is to simply share links to great questions or answers. The hallmark, the cornerstone, the fundamental bedrock of Stack Exchange is producing Q&A; that we’re proud of, Q&A; that’s worthy of sharing with others. 
</blockquote>



I'm incredibly proud of the quality of Q&A; being generated on [Stack Exchange sites](http://stackexchange.com) -- it's a testament to the skill of our community, which IMNSHO is second to none on the intarwebs. I love building Q&A; that _makes the internet better_ alongside you guys. So when you see a particularly brilliant question or answer -- why not **share it and let everyone else know just how great our communities are?**

And remember, that first upvote is always free ...

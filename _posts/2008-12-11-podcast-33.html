This is the thirty-third episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and<br />
Jeff sit down with special guest Babak Ghahremanpour, the lead developer for FogBugz.</p>
<ul>
<li>I gifted the Fog Creek office with <a href="http://www.fakeplasticrock.com/2008/11/05/fake-plastic-cymbals/">a set of cymbals for the Rock Band 2 drums</a>, to complement the <a href="http://www.fakeplasticrock.com/2008/03/31/equipping-your-first-fake-plastic-rock-band/">sweet Rock Band setup</a> I bought for them earlier this year. And yes, I already got them <a href="http://www.fakeplasticrock.com/2008/11/21/the-ultimate-vocalist-battlestation/">a tambourine and cowbell</a>.</li>
<li>We're starting to seriously consider <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/12/server-hosting-rent-vs-buy/">buying our own servers and renting rackspace</a> for the Stack Overflow servers. It makes sense to us from both from a financial standpoint and from a performance standpoint. We're also considering some of the cloud services like Amazon EC2 and Windows Azure.</li>
<li>We wonder why so much of the software that's bundled with hardware is so terrible. There's nothing scarier to me as a software developer than the DVD labelled "Install me!" provided with some bit of hardware that I just bought. Why is that?</li>
<li>I tend to agree that one danger sign for a new programming job is the requirement to be on call. This is a bit more normal for sysadmin positions, but it's unusual (and arguably unhealthy) for programmers.</li>
<li>Joel and I note that developing software predisposes you to "debug" real world processes that largely aren't worth the effort. Beware!</li>
<li>We've probably mentioned this before, but whatever else you decide to do with your database, it is incredibly important that you <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001050.html">get your database under version control</a>.</li>
<li>Does it make sense for every software developer to start their own company, which is what <a href="http://paulgraham.com/start.html">Paul Graham seems to advocate</a>? It's certainly one of the few paths to becoming very wealthy, if that's your primary goal.</li>
<li>If you just can't get enough Spolsky, Joel was featured on the <a href="http://startuppodcast.wordpress.com/">Startup Success podcast</a> with Bob Walsh and Patrick Foley.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our favorite Stack Overflow questions this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jeff</strong>: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/136443/why-doesnt-ie7-copy-precode-blocks-to-the-clipboard-correctly">Why doesn't IE7 copy PRE CODE blocks to the clipboard correctly?</a> This is sort of cheating because it's my own question, but it's a perfect example of using Stack Overflow to build Stack Overflow! We are the target audience, too.
</li>
<li><strong>Joel</strong>: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/242996/dealbreakers-for-new-programming-jobs">Dealbreakers for new programming jobs</a>. Some great responses to this question; worth a read if you're looking for a new job.</li>
<li><strong>Babak</strong>: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/164432/what-real-life-bad-habits-has-programming-given-you">What real life bad habits has programming given you?</a> We alluded to this question in the previous podcast; it's a classic.</li>
</ul>
<p>We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Peter Bailey</strong>: "When you're designing a new application, how much code (triggers and stored procedures) do you put in the database?"</li>
<li><strong>Vincent Tan</strong>: "What are your top 3 costs in running a software business, and how do you reduce them?"</li>
</ol>

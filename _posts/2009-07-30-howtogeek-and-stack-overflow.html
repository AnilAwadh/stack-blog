Remember the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/why-cant-you-have-just-one-site/">League of Justice</a> I said we were forming?</p>
<p>
Well, I'm thrilled to announce that our League has added its <b>first new superhero</b>: the <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/">How-To Geek</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/" style="border-bottom:none"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/how-to-geek-logo.png" alt="how-to-geek-logo" title="how-to-geek-logo" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>
I've been a fan of <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/">The Geek's site</a> since the very first time I discovered it in late 2007. It's a fantastic resource filled with great content, and <i>just</i> the right tone. I knew he had a massive success on his hands from day one, and I've had an off-and-on email correspondence with Lowell (aka The Geek) long before Stack Overflow was anything more than a gleam in Joel's eye. This has been in the works for a while.</p>
<p>
The Geek is truly one of us. He's a programmer who had a Stack Overflow account since the beginning ...</p>
<p>

<p>
... <i>and</i> he can <a href="http://twitter.com/howtogeek/status/2926027208">solve a Rubik's cube in 3 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>
Like us, Lowell believes in <b>the power of getting good content out on the web</b> and in the hands of the community -- and <i>always</i> in a clean, ethical, web-friendly way.</p>
<p>
That's why I am proud to announce our official affiliation. Starting today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lowell will be an <a href="http://superuser.com/users/4102/the-how-to-geek">active moderator</a> and participant on <a href="http://superuser.com">Super User</a>, helping drive the direction and content of the site.
</li>
<li>Our "hero roster" at the bottom of every page will offically list howtogeek.com as a member of the team.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/">How-To Geek</a> will act as the 'editorial content' yin to <a href="http://superuser.com">Super User</a> 'user-generated content' yang, in order to complement and support each other.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This partnership is tremendously exciting to me. By combining forces into our own little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League">Justice League</a> on the web we hope to not only help each other grow, but also to deliver great <i>justice</i> to the web, together, in the form of first-rate content and community!</p>
<p>
Any <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001246.html">evil</a> we defeat along the way will, I'm sure, be completely coincidental ...</p>
<p>
<small>oh, and stay tuned for <i>another</i> superhero we're recruiting into our League over the next months..</small></p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p></p>

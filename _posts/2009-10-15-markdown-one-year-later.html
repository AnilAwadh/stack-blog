<p>
We made a few key technology bets when we created Stack Overflow:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/">ASP.NET MVC</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'll defer the discussion on the other two items for another day, but after <b>spending a year immersed in Markdown</b> -- <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/editing-help">the lightweight markup language we use to format posts on all Trilogy sites</a> -- I have some thoughts I'd like to share.</p>
<p>
We knew early on that there were <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/06/three-markdown-gotcha/">a handful of Markdown Gotchas</a>, thanks to the sage advice of John Fraser (who, sadly, I have completely lost contact with.) Based on those gotchas, we quickly adjusted our Markdown support to fix a few obvious things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Removed support for intra-word emphasis <code>like_this_example</code>
</li>
<li>Added auto-hyperlink support for http:// URLs in posts
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Apparently github also uses Markdown, and they independently arrived at some of the same conclusions we did -- synthesizing something they call <a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Removed support for intra-word emphasis <code>like_this_example</code>
</li>
<li>Added auto-hyperlink support for http:// URLs in posts
</li>
<li>Automatic return-based linebreaks instead of "two spaces at end of line" linebreaks
</li>
<li>Support for some magic strings that auto-convert to GitHub specific links
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Since GitHub and Stack Overflow match exactly on #1 and #2, it's fairly safe to say that those are in fact deficiencies in Markdown, at least for a programming audience. (Though I'd argue they apply to general audiences, too.)</p>
<p>
As for #3, that's one I hadn't considered. In normal Markdown, this:</p>
<p><pre>
Roses are red&#182;
Violets are blue&#182;
</pre>
<p>
Will render like this:</p>
<pre>
Roses are red violets are blue
</pre>
<p>
The Markdown answer is to add two spaces at the end of the line (or a literal &lt;br&gt;, I suppose).</p>
<p><pre>
Roses are red&nbsp;&nbsp;&#182;
violets are blue&#182;
</pre>
<p>
Although it's easy <i>once you know the trick</i>, this is far from intuitive to most. I'm reminded a bit of the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000096.html">double-click mouse problem</a>. I wonder if we should adopt the GitHub linebreak approach here. </p>
<p>
As for the fourth item, when text is entered in these specific formats ...</p>
<p><pre>
* SHA: be6a8cc1c1ecfe9489fb51e4869af15a13fc2cd2
* User@SHA ref: mojombo@be6a8cc1c1ecfe9489fb51e4869af15a13fc2cd2
* User/Project@SHA: mojombo/god@be6a8cc1c1ecfe9489fb51e4869af15a13fc2cd2
* \#Num: #1
* User/#Num: mojombo#1
* User/Project#Num: mojombo/god#1
</pre>
<p>
... those magic strings are detected by the GitHub Flavored Markdown and auto-converted into GitHub specific hyperlinks. <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/1010/advanced-syntax-ideas">Something similar</a> has been proposed on meta for internal Stack Overflow references, so this is an idea we've been entertaining for some time as well.</p>
<p>
Markdown is remarkably flexible, because it allows you to intermix <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/1777/what-html-tags-are-allowed">a narrow list of whitelisted HTML</a> tags with <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/editing-help">Markdown "fancy ASCII" syntax</a> in a fairly logical way, at least most of the time.</p>
<p>
So, now that <i>you've</i> had a chance to mess around with Markdown for a year -- <b>what are your thoughts?</b></p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>

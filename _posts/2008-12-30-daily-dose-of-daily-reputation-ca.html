<p>It's your daily dose of everyone's best friend, the <strong>+200 per day Stack Overflow reputation cap!</strong></p>
<p>Did you know that...</p>
<ol>
<li>Without the +200 per day reputation cap, <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/9134/jon-skeet-facts">a certain</a>Â Stack Overflow user would have almost 60,000 reputation?</li>
<li>Implementing a logarithmic decline in the value of upvotes would make almost no difference to most people's reputation scores?</li>
<li>Capping all posts at 10 votes (for scoring purposes only) would make almost no difference to most people's reputation scores?</li>
</ol>
<p>I didn't, until today! Behold the power of the <em>daily reputation cap!</em></p>
<p>However, based on feedback to the previous bug fix to the daily reputation cap, we are making the following changes tonight:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Accepted answers are now immune to the daily reputation cap</strong>. Again. This time as part of a policy and not a bug.</li>
<li><strong>Partial votes will be awarded if necessary to reach the daily reputation cap.</strong> In other words, if you are at 195 today, and someone casts an upvote for your posts right now, you'll get 5 reputation. Prior to tonight, you'd get none.</li>
</ol>
<p>The partial vote awards sort of reminds me of Superman III, as described in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/">Office Space</a>.</p>
<pre><strong>PETER </strong>Yeah. I, I, I...Listen, that virus you're always talking about. The one
that, that could rip off the company for a bunch of money...

<strong>MICHAEL </strong>Yeah? What about it?

<strong>PETER </strong>Well, how does it work?

<strong>MICHAEL </strong>It's pretty brilliant. What it does is where there's a bank
transaction, and the interests are computed in the thousands a day in
fractions of a cent, which it usually rounds off. What this does is it
takes those remainders and puts it into your account.

<strong>PETER </strong>This sounds familiar.

<strong>MICHAEL </strong>Yeah. They did this in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086393/">Superman III</a>.

<a style="border-bottom: none;" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086393/"><img title="superman iii" src="assets/super_iii.jpg" alt="superman iii" border="0" /></a>

<strong>PETER </strong>Yeah. What a good movie.

<strong>MICHAEL </strong>A bunch of hackers did this in the 70s and one of them got busted.

<strong>PETER </strong>Well, so they check for this now?

<strong>MICHAEL </strong>No, you see, Initech's so backed up with all the software we're
updating for the year 2000, they'd never notice.</pre>
<p>So, enjoy your newly regained reputation scores! I guess that's why we still keep that beta disclaimer on the front page..</p>

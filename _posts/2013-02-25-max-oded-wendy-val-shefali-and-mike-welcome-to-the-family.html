<p>We've been busy hiring more of the most talented people on the planet! Three cheers for the newest employees at Stack Exchange:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/189572/max"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-13170" style="border: 1px solid black;margin-right: 2em" alt="" src="assets/Horstmann-Max.jpg" width="200" height="200" /></a>Max Horstmann, Web Developer (Careers 2.0)</strong></p>
<p><em>New York</em></p>
<p><em></em>Max joins Stack Exchange as a developer on the Careers team. Originally from Denzlingen, Germany, he previously worked on the Windows team at Microsoft. On a recent one-year career break, he and his wife had a chance to travel to glaciers in South America, deserts in the Middle East, and jungles in Southeast Asia. His mission for the next five years is to sort all the pictures taken on this trip, write a few more mobile apps, and find out which German bar in New York City plays the best <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzNP1SNxR24" target="_blank">Blasmusik</a>.</p>

<p><em>London</em></p>
<p>A long time Stack Overflow user and contributor (Beta badge, baby!), Oded is highly familiar with the ins and outs of Stack Overflow and promises not to introduce too many bugs. Originally from Jerusalem, Israel, he now lives in London, England with his wife and two children.</p>

<p><em>New York</em></p>
<p>Wendy grew up in Wisconsin and has been living in New York for over five years.  She is very excited to move into the tech field as a member of the Stack Exchange team. Outside of work, you might find Wendy sharing a delicious meal with friends in a restaurant, checking out a concert, show, or museum, taking a spin or yoga class, or pretending to be a Food Network star in her Brooklyn kitchen.</p>

<p><em>London<strong></strong></em></p>
<p>Val was born in Argentina (won't eat beef), grew up in Ottawa, Canada (hates snow), and has lived in London for 15 years and couldn't imagine living anywhere else. She has a certificate in Web Application Development from the Open University, and is mega excited to have the opportunity to work for Stack Overflow and set up the way the new London office will be run. On her spare time Val is part of the Jeerios, the jeerleading squad for the London Rollergirls. She also loves music, dancing, baking, and dinosaurs.</p>

<p><em>Denver</em></p>
<p>Hailing from the bustling city of Mumbai, Shefali is an interesting mix of the East-and-West. Armed with a BS in Business Admin with an emphasis in Finance and Entrepreneurship from CU Boulder, she is excited to join and contribute to the Stack Exchange team. On the weekends you will find Shefali dancing with her East Indian Dance Company all over Colorado, or just catching a meal or a flick with her homies around town.</p>

<p><em>Denver</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Michael is a native of Atlanta, GA who moved to Colorado 11 years ago to go CU Boulder.  He met his wife in while in school and decided to trade humidity for all four seasons and a plethora of microbreweries (Belgium, Aged Sours, Cask Ale… Yes Please!). On the weekends you will find Michael chilling with his family, trying a new breakfast joint, exploring the Rockies and/or playing competitive baseball.</p>

I am pleased to announce that <b>Stack Overflow just added another team member in an officially paid capacity: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/3/jarrod-dixon">Jarrod Dixon</a></b>.</p>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/welcome-jarrod-dixon-stackoverflow-employee-002.jpg" alt="welcome-jarrod-dixon-stackoverflow-valued-associate-002" title="welcome-jarrod-dixon-stackoverflow-valued-associate-002" /></p>
<p>
Jarrod and I met on the job in 2002, and became fast friends. Here was the rare programmer who loved to code every bit as much as I did. It was our calling, and we recognized that in each other almost immediately.</p>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/KVyDa.jpg" width="103" height="103" alt="I &lt;3 code" /></p>
<p>
I wasn't sure exactly why we got along so well, until we went to one of those corporate teambuilding events that <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html">Paul Graham loves so much</a>.  During the event, the moderator had everyone go to a corner of the room, depending on whether you were..</p>
<ul>
<li>the oldest child in your family
</li>
<li>a middle child in your family
</li>
<li>the youngest child in your family
</li>
<li>the only child in your family
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Of the entire room of 30+ people, only Jarrod and I ended up in the "only child" corner. Our coworkers sadly shook their heads and agreed: <i>this explains a lot.</i></p>
<p>
It was always our goal for Stack Overflow to be a modest but self-sustaining business. Bringing Jarrod on as <b>Stack Overflow Valued Associate #00002</b>, there to work daily on the site alongside me, is an important milestone toward this goal. In a (very) small way, I want to do what Joel did: build a <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/12/29.html">fantastic environment</a> for programmers to work on interesting problems. OK, so the fantastic environment isn't quite there yet, but I do <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000666.html">put my money where my mouth is</a>: we've already bought Jarrod a Mirra chair, a blazing fast desktop computer, and a 30" monitor.</p>
<p>
Just for the record -- and I am not trying to put a guilt trip on anyone, I'm just explaining the way things are -- <b>pretty much all the Stack Overflow advertising revenue that comes in goes <i>directly</i> to Jarrod's salary</b>. True story. This is the way I want it. In all honesty, nothing makes me happier than paying my dear friend -- who also happens to be an incredibly talented developer -- to work on this project with me. And with you! Having Jarrod on board means we can satisfy <a href="http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/">top rated UserVoice requests</a> much faster, and build cool new stuff into the site with greater regularity.</p>
<p>
(also, not to be be crass, but if you're interested in advertising on Stack Overflow do <a href="mailto:ads@stackoverflow.com">drop us an email</a>. Help us feed a fellow programmer!)</p>
<p>
Now, Stack Overflow is bigger than Jarrod and I; it's only through the contributions of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/about">our entire team</a> that we've gotten to where we are today. I do hope to bring on more of our excellent team in a formally paid capacity as we continue growing the site. Gotta crawl before you can walk.</p>
<p>
2009 is shaping up to be a great year for Stack Overflow. We have big plans. I'll be blogging about them shortly. We need your input, because we know it isn't <i>about</i> us -- <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/11/stack-overflow-is-you/">Stack Overflow is You</a>. </p>

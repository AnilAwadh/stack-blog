<p>Another long-standing request, dating all the way back to 2009, is for a <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/896/mobile-and-iphone-optimized-version-of-stack-overflow">mobile optimized view of Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
<p>Since &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>the existing HTML and CSS was (and still is) rather light
</li>
<li>the original iPhone did a <i>great</i> job rendering Stack Overflow
</li>
<li>mobile traffic on Stack Overflow is only about 1% of traffic
</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; we didn't feel this was urgent back in 2009. Or 2010.</p>
<p>But things are different now. Great mobile smartphones are (almost) ubiquitous now, with more and more people <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/3495/the-rise-of-mobile-email/">regularly accessing the web</a> on the go. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/06/performance-is-a-feature.html">Performance is a family value</a>, and there's no question that a proper set of HTML optimized for small screens offers a faster, smoother experience. Also, any work we do on a mobile design is now effective on not just a trilogy of websites, but <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">fifty-seven different Stack Exchange sites!</a> Overall we felt it was time to roll up our sleeves and build a new rendering path for small-screen mobile devices.</p>
<p>We've had the mobile design in private and public beta for a while to polish up all the obvious rough edges. Now it's officially blessed for everyone across the entire network. <b>If we detect a whitelisted mobile device user agent, you will automatically receive an optimized mobile view of any Stack Exchange on your smartphone.</b></p>

<p>Mobile Stack Exchange is intended to be a <i>fully functional version of Stack Exchange</i> -- that is, you can ask questions, answer questions, vote, favorite, comment and all the other essential things you would expect.</p>

<p>Please note, however, that if you do find anything you can't do on mobile, there are <b>links at the bottom of the page to switch from mobile to desktop view</b> at will. We also remember this setting on a per-user basis.</p>
<p>Now go forth and enjoy Stack Exchange sites from wherever you happen to be on whatever mobile device you have. Go ahead. Give it a shot. And after using it, if you have any specific feedback for us on the mobile view, <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/98776/stack-exchange-mobile-launched">please leave it in this meta question</a>.</p>

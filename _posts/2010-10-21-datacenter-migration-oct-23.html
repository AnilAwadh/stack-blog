<p>This <b>Saturday, October 23rd</b>, starting at about 2 PM Pacific, we will be migrating all of our primary sites from the <b>Corvallis, OR</b> datacenter to the <b>New York, NY</b> datacenter.</p>
<p><img src="assets/oregon-to-nyc-server-trail.png" alt="" title="oregon-to-nyc-server-trail" width="600" height="351" /></p>
<p>Please be advised that this is a major move, and while we will do everything we can to prevent major service interruptions (largely with a read-only site mode we're introducing), <b style="color:maroon">there may be a few hours of unavoidable downtime</b>.</p>
<p>This move is good news, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>NYC is approximately <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/137348/how-much-network-latency-is-typical-for-east-west-coast-usa">80 milliseconds closer</a> to Europe, which is where a significant portion of our audience arrives from. And of course dramatically closer to the rest of the east coast of the USA.
</li>
<li>The Peer 1 internet network infrastructure should be faster.
</li>
<li>The servers all have twice as much memory (16 GB web tier, 64 GB database tier) and their CPUs are one generation ahead of what we have in Corvallis (Core 2 vs Core i7 class).
</li>
<li>There's a lot more of ... <a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/post/1432571770/stack-overflows-new-york-data-center">uh, everything</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>At <i>worst</i> this NYC configuration will be the same speed overall -- but much more robust. At <i>best</i>, you should notice 100 to 150 millisecond improvement in response time on every single page.</p>
<p>As always, you can read real time updates and details about the move on <a href="http://blog.serverfault.com">blog.serverfault.com</a>.</p>
<p><font color="maroon">update: this migration is now complete.</font> We have a few very minor things left to clean up, but for the most part everything should be working as before.</p>

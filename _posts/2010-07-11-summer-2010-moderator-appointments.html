<p>
Due to a continual and ever-growing stream of moderator flags on <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/">the classic trilogy</a> -- and a desire to be respectful of the time our existing community moderators are so generously contributing to our community -- I recently <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/56396/summer-2010-moderator-appointments">proposed on meta</a> that we add moderators to each classic trilogy site:</p>
<p><h2>Stack Overflow</h2>
<table width="450" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tr>
<td>
            <iframe marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="210" height="60" src="http://stackoverflow.com/users/flair/1228.html"><br />
            </iframe>
</td>
<td>
            <iframe marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="210" height="60" src="http://stackoverflow.com/users/flair/13531.html"><br />
            </iframe>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>(came in 3rd and 4th in <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/02/stack-overflow-2010-moderator-election-results/">our 2010 election</a>)</p>
<h2>Super User</h2>
<p>            <iframe marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="210" height="60" src="http://superuser.com/users/flair/3110.html"><br />
            </iframe> </p>
<h2>Server Fault</h2>
<p>            <iframe marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="210" height="60" src="http://serverfault.com/users/flair/1435.html"><br />

Please welcome our newest community moderators to the family!</p>
<p>
As always, I recommend reading through our <b><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/">theory of moderation</a></b> which is best summarized by <b>moderate as little as possible</b>. Our community moderators are human exception handlers, but as the sites continue to grow (Stack Overflow's growth is particularly extreme) those unusual exception conditions happen more often. </p>
<p>
Will there continue to be future moderator elections? <i>Absolutely</i>. My experience so far has taught me that -- all other things being equal -- it's better to have more moderation than less. I agree that appointments aren't ideal, I would prefer to run elections, but we have urgent needs on the trilogy. I believe that every moderator we've appointed today lives up to our moderator selection ideals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Must be a currently registered user in good standing.
</li>
<li>Must have a reasonably high reputation score to indicate active, consistent participation.
</li>
<li>Should exhibit patience and fairness at all times in their questions, answers, and comments.
</li>
<li>Should lead by example, showing respect for their fellow community members in everything they write.
</li>
<li>They should want the responsibility. Being a community moderator isn't an obligation, it is completely voluntary.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
As Robert alluded to in his excellent Stack Exchange 2.0 beta primer, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/the-7-essential-meta-questions-of-every-beta/">The 7 Essential Meta Questions of Every Beta</a>, <b>we will be building out community moderator election support as a standard feature of all Stack Exchange 2.0 sites in the near future.</b></p>
<p>
We're not there yet, but soon!</p>

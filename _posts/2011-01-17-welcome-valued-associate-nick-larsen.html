<p>2011 is starting off with a bang! I'm excited to announce that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/178082/nicklarsen" target="_blank">Nick Larsen</a> has joined the Stack Overflow team in our NYC headquarters.</p>
<p>Nick relocated from Atlanta, GA with his lovely wife Mary Paige, a graphic designer, and their rescued dachshund Maddy, a nap enthusiast. They're settling into their new apartment on the Upper East Side conveniently located near the “small dog” park and a tequila bar. As if this isn’t enough to keep him busy, Nick also builds and launches high power rockets.</p>

<p>As part of the <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow Careers</a> programming team, Nick is working to take the user experience to the next level.</p>

<p>
Stack Overflow has exactly four moderators: Joel, Jeff (me), Jarrod, and Geoff. It's no coincidence that the list of moderators is identical to the list of co-founders and mainline developers.</p>
<p>
As we launch the upcoming IT / SysAdmin sister site, we've had very little luck locating notable folks from that community to act as moderators and spiritual leaders for the site. So <b>we're flirting with the idea of promoting users with high reputation scores and the respect of the community to moderator status</b>.</p>
<p>
Moderators (indicated by the small star icon) are the most highly trusted members of the system, so this is not something we take lightly. Moderators can:</p>
<ul>
<li>cast one-shot binding votes on open, close, delete, and offensive.
</li>
<li>edit anything in the system, including user profiles.
</li>
<li>delete revisions.
</li>
<li>have visibility into our internal error logs.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
.. and so forth. </p>
<p>
It occurred to me that we might as well test this theory out by starting with Stack Overflow itself. So let's give this a shot. Reply in the comments, nominating up to <i>three</i> Stack Overflow users you think would make good moderators. Some ground rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Must be a currently registered Stack Overflow user in good standing
</li>
<li>Must have <b>at least 7,000 reputation</b> (I was going to say 10k, but as long as you're in the ballpark, that's fine.)
</li>
<li>Should exhibit <b>patience</b> and <b>fairness</b> at all times in their questions, answers, and comments.
</li>
<li>Should lead by example, showing <b>respect for their fellow programmers</b> in everything they write.
</li>
<li>They should want the responsibility. Nominating users isn't the same as an obligation. It's purely voluntary.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The nomination period will last for one week. At that point, I'll tally the nominations up and put it to a public vote -- but only registered Stack Overflow users with a reputation score of 200 or higher will be able to cast votes!</p>
<p>
<font color="red">update:</font> voting is <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/stack-overflow-moderator-voting-now-open/">now open</a> from May 6 until May 13.</p>

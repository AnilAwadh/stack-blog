Remember when I talked about <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/eating-our-own-careers-dogfood/">Eating Our Own Careers Dogfood</a>? Well, that applies to <i>all</i> of our sites, not just Stack Overflow. Including <a href="http://serverfault.com/">Server Fault</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://serverfault.com/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/serverfault-logo.png" alt="" title="serverfault-logo" width="252" height="51" /></a></p>
<p>
I'm pleased to announce we're <b>expanding our team on the System Administrator side with <a href="http://serverfault.com/users/2561/kyle-brandt">Server Fault user Kyle Brandt</a></b>.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://serverfault.com/users/2561/kyle-brandt"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bio-kyle-brandt.jpg" alt="" title="bio-kyle-brandt" width="248" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3896" /></a></p>
<p>
(yes, <i>technically</i> this means Kyle is Stack Overflow Valued Associate #00009, since the actual name of the company is Stack Overflow Internet Services, Incorporated. But I personally prefer to think of him as Server Fault Valued Associate #00001.)</p>
<p>
In addition to helping us build out <a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/post/633403731/phase-two">the bigger, badder New York datacenter</a> and assisting us in keeping our servers and network running smoothly, Kyle will be driving the <a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/">Server Fault Blog</a>. We believe in being as transparent as possible about what we're doing, and how we're doing it -- both by actively participating in Server Fault every day and by contributing information and support to the greater sysadmin community. To that end, Kyle has already published a great new post about <a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/post/747186396/serverfault-trees">fault tree analysis</a> on his very first day. You can expect more of this in the future.</p>
<p>
Will we be doing <i>more</i> hiring from Server Fault? <i>You bet your sweet RAID arrays we will!</i> Stay tuned.</p>
<p /></p></p></p>

<p><span>You do. I’ll bet like a bazillion <a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">bitcoins</a> on it.</span></p>
<p><span>You’re a human. You’re curious. You don’t know everything. You frequently use <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/44516/what-is-the-difference-between-inflection-and-intonation/44521#44521">intonation</a> at the end of your thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span>Some questions previously brought to <a title="Stack Exchange" href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Are humans the best marathon runners on earth? <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6114/can-trained-humans-run-faster-than-all-other-animals-on-a-marathon-distance/6115#6115" target="_blank">No</a>.</li>
<li>Is there a use in the kitchen for salmon heads and spines? <a href="http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/18130/is-there-any-use-to-salmon-heads-and-spines/18152#18152" target="_blank">Yes</a>.</li>
<li>Are pedestrians allowed to use the bike lane? <a href="http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/6190/are-runners-allowed-to-use-the-bike-lane/6214#6214" target="_blank">Maybe</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>We are so smart!</span></p>
<p><span>By “we,” I mean you, me… humans. Slam a bunch of keyboard characters in celebration!@#$* We nudge friends, ping strangers and query Google when we feel brave enough to fill the itchy vacancies in the libraries of our brains. Asking, I think, might be one of the critical differences between man and the rest of the animal kingdom. Yes, asking and sarcasm and Google.</span></p>
<p><span>But how do you prompt a human to ask a question? That’s a problem I’ve wrestled with since joining Stack Exchange in July. How do I remind you that you had that one question while you were drooling into your popcorn while watching that impossibly slow <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/3698/movies">Terrance Malick movie</a>?</span></p>
<p><span>Should I send you a swag bag full of Stack Exchange branded notepads?</span></p>
<p><span>It’s hard to remember a question you conceived in the past. It’s much easier, on the other hand, to plug your question into a search field right as the question dawns on you (which is why we need to work on brand awareness at Stack Exchange, not to mention mobile, but that’s a discussion for another time).</span></p>
<p><span>Maybe we don’t readily recall what we once wondered because, for the vast majority of human existence, questions were mostly unanswerable. From 12 to 11:59 on the clock of human history, questions did little more than drive cavemen mad. “Why is the moon acting all crazy, yo!”</span></p>
<p><span>Today, things are different.</span></p>

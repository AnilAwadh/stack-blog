<p>It was one year ago today that <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/07/stack-overflow-private-beta-begins/">the Stack Overflow private beta</a> started.  The <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4">first question</a> was asked at 21:42 on July 31st, 2008.</p>
<p>
Which means we've been doing this thing <i>in public</i> for a full year now -- it's <b>a Stack Overflow birthday!</b></p>
<p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/i-hope-you-enjoy-your-birthday-infinitely.png" alt="i-hope-you-enjoy-your-birthday-infinitely" title="i-hope-you-enjoy-your-birthday-infinitely" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1778" /></p>
<p>
Some stats for our first year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three new "family" sites have launched (<a href="http://serverfault.com">serverfault.com</a>, <a href="http://superuser.com">superuser.com</a>, and <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com">meta.stackoverflow.com</a>)
</li>
<li>208 blog posts have been posted
</li>
<li>63 podcasts have been recorded
</li>
<li>258,560 questions have been asked; 932,356 answers have been provided
</li>
<li>104,213 registered accounts have been created
</li>
<li>two full-time associates are on board (<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00002/">Jarrod</a> and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00003/">Geoff</a>)
</li>
<li>Stack Overflow now peaks at 965k pageviews per day, and 414k visits per day.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
But more important than any of this, is that I think <b>we've honestly raised the quality bar for getting good answers to programming questions on the internet</b>. There is <i>nothing</i> more thrilling to me than clicking on a Stack Overflow family search result in my own web searches -- I know the page will load fast, and the information I seek will be right at hand. And it'll be clean, clear, and formatted well through the tireless fractional effort of programmers just like me. Oh, and I do my part too -- I vote the <i>heck</i> out of things I find useful, and always try to leave them better than I found them, by providing more information in an answer or comment, or editing the posts for clarity. </p>
<p>
If this thing we've been doing for the past year has been a success, I can't take credit for that. <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/11/stack-overflow-is-you/">But you can</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This is the scary part, the great leap of faith that Stack Overflow is predicated on: <b>trusting your fellow programmers</b>. The programmers who choose to participate in Stack Overflow are the “secret sauce” that makes it work. You are the reason I continue to believe in developer community as the greatest source of learning and growth. You are the reason I continue to get so many positive emails and testimonials about Stack Overflow. I can’t take credit for that. But you can.</p>
<p>
I learned the collective power of my fellow programmers long ago writing on Coding Horror. The community is far, far smarter than I will ever be. All I can ask — all any of us can ask — is to help each other along the path.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nothing motivates me more than the idea that, <b>together, we're raising the quality of our little corner of the internet in a tiny but measurable way</b>. It is both a pleasure and an honor to serve the community in this endeavor, and I look forward to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001207.html">many more years of the same</a>.</p>

The name stackoverflow.com was <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001095.html">partially chosen by the community</a>, with stackoverflow.com winning by a virtual landslide.</p>
<p>
But websites can't survive on name alone. We also need a logo. A logo with verve. With zazz. With moxie! A dynamic logo that reflects the potential of this mythical programming community site we're building.</p>
<p>
Rather than try out my anemic design skills -- it's always dangerous when programmers start thinking they're designers -- I thought I'd put the logo design to the community in similar fashion. We have <a href="http://99designs.com/contests/6774">a stackoverflow.com logo design contest at 99 designs</a>, with a prize of $2<sup>9</sup> at stake.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://99designs.com/contests/6774" style="border-bottom:none;"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/99-designs-logo.png" alt="99 designs logo" title="99 designs logo" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>
I've been quite impressed by many of the <a href="http://99designs.com/contests/6774">submissions</a> so far. The contest runs for another five days, so if you're interested, please submit a logo!</p>
<p /></p></p>

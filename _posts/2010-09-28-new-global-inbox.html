<p>One unwanted side effect of launching so many <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">awesome new Stack Exchange network sites</a> is that the more you participated in, the harder it became to keep track of all your questions, answers, and comments across every site you participated on. That's kind of a bummer.</p>
<p>Well, I'm pleased to announce we've added a new global inbox to every site in our network. On <b>the genuine<sup>tm</sup> Stack Exchange logo in the upper left hand corner</b>, the one you already <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/network-central-stackexchange-com/">know and love</a> -- you may see a new, small red numeric indicator light up:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/global-inbox-notify.png" alt="" title="global-inbox-notify" width="266" height="98" style="border: 1px solid silver;" /></p>
<p>That small red number tells you <b>how many new replies you have across the entire <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">Stack Exchange network</a></b> of websites. And by replies, I mean:</p>
<ol>
<li>New answers to your questions
</li>
<li>New comments on your posts
</li>
<li>@replies to you in comments
</li>
</ol>
<p>Click the number to go directly to the global inbox.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/global-inbox-expanded.png" alt="" title="global-inbox-expanded" width="395" height="368" style="border: 1px solid silver;" /></p>
<p>At any given time, the inbox will contain a list of the last 30 global messages for your account, along with:</p>
<ul>
<li>The site icon, so you know which site the message is from
</li>
<li>The title of the question the message is associated with
</li>
<li>A preview excerpt of the first few characters of the message
</li>
<li>The relative age of the message (in a tooltip, so hover your mouse to see it)
</li>
</ul>
<p>Clicking through on any global inbox item will of course take you directly to the specific question on the target site.</p>
<p>Hopefully the new global inbox will <b>make it easier to keep track of your questions, answers, and comments across the entire network!</b> </p>
<p>(and yes, we're looking at ways for chat to discreetly insert @reply mentions in the global inbox as well.)</p>

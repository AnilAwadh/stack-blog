<p>Back in January we <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/stack-overflow-search-now-81-less-crappy/">rebooted our search implementation</a>, replacing it with <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net/">Lucene.Net</a>. We've been quite happy with the results, which are faster, more relevant, and ... perhaps not Google quality, but certainly getting closer to the realm of <i>Googlesque</i>.</p>
<p>We are also big fans of the Lucene.Net project, which has <a href="http://codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2010/11/01/Lucene-Net-needs-your-help-or-it-will-die.aspx">had some rocky times of late</a>. I asked the core contributors to the Lucene.Net project what we could do to help, and Troy Howard came up with something interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We'd love to take advantage of your offer for help. I've been trying to think of the most awesome thing that Stack Overflow could do for us, and I think I've finally found it.</p>
<p>
I've been following Jeff's blog for a long time, and I recall very well <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/04/help-name-our-website.html">his initial posts on stackoverflow.com in 2008</a> and the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/04/logo-design-contest-winner/">logo design contest</a>. This was repeated with the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/logo-contest-winner-for-serverfaultcom/">serverfault</a> and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/logo-contest-winner-for-superusercom/">superuser</a> ... You guys are awesome at this. Your logos look great. The process is fun. Everyone wins.</p>
<p>
We've been debating the logo used by Lucene.Net, which all agree is terrible. We would like to have a logo design contest in the spirit of your successful campaigns to get a new logo for Lucene.Net. The new logo would symbolize the rebirth of the project and the new philosophy that goes with it. It's also a great opportunity to have a publicity stunt which will attract a lot of community interest to the project, both as users and hopefully as contributors.</p>
<p>
So, what I ask of Stack Overflow, is to host, promote, manage, and pay for our logo design contest exactly as if it was a design contest for your company's products. Would this be a reasonable request?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
More than reasonable! In honor of the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/LUCENENET/lucenenet-hackathon-may-2011.html">Lucene.Net hackathon</a> going on right now in Ireland, I set up a <b><a href="https://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/help-lucene-net-logo-77574">99designs.com logo contest</a></b> on behalf of the Lucene.Net project.</p>
<p>
So they can go from these old and busted logos ... </p>
<p>
<a href="https://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/help-lucene-net-logo-77574"><img src="assets/lucene-logo.png" alt="" title="lucene-logo" width="330" height="60" /></a><br />
<a href="https://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/help-lucene-net-logo-77574"><img src="assets/apache-lucene-net-old-logo.png" alt="" title="apache-lucene-net-old-logo" width="183" height="86" /></a></p>
<p>
To something much, much cooler!</p>
<p>
(As with our previous logo contests, expect some form of prize for the 2nd and 3rd place designs as well.)</p>
<p>
So please do help us spread the word -- both about the Lucene.Net project itself, which powers search across the <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">entire Stack Exchange network</a> brilliantly, and also about the <b><a href="https://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/help-lucene-net-logo-77574">Lucene.Net logo contest</a></b>!</p>
<p /></p></p></p>

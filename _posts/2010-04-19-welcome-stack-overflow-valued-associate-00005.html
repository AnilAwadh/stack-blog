As we embark upon the next phase of the Stack Overflow adventure -- much of which is documented in <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/post/518474918/stack-exchange-2-0">Stack Exchange 2.0</a> -- we realized that we desperately, <i>desperately</i> needed someone whose full time job is to engage with the community. Both on a technical level and on a human level. </p>
<p>
I'm pleased to announce that we've hired <b>our first full time community coordinator</b> -- <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/98786/robert-c-cartaino">Robert C. Cartaino</a>.</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/robert-cartaino.jpg" alt="" title="robert-cartaino" width="400" height="446" /></p>
<p>
I can't imagine anyone better suited for this role than Robert. He's a programmer with a deep background in online community going all the way back to the modem and BBS era. He's been actively involved in practically every stage of Stack Overflow <i>and</i> Stack Exchange, both as participant and observer. </p>
<p>
Robert, in other words, is <i>one of us</i>. Part city planner, part sociologist, part programmer -- focused on collectively building thriving communities on the currency of <b>information</b>, freely shared not just between ourselves, but with the entire world of the internet.</p>
<p>
We want to <b>build our team by hiring from the community</b>, and Robert is a great example of exactly the kind of community we're trying to build -- a tribe of smart, rational, knowledgable people who all love this stuff as much as we do.</p>
<p /></p></p></p>

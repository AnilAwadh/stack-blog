<p>
In tonight's code push, we added the ability to <b>vote for comments</b>, and <b>flag comments if they are inappropriate</b>.</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/stackoverflow-comment-flags-votes.png" alt="stackoverflow-comment-flags-votes" title="stackoverflow-comment-flags-votes" style="border: 1px solid silver;" /></p>
<p>
Some ground rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no downvoting of comments, only upvotes.
</li>
<li>Comment votes do not affect comment sort order.
</li>
<li>No reputation of any kind is earned or lost from comment votes.
</li>
<li>Each user gets 5 comment flag votes, and 30 comment upvotes, per day.
</li>
<li>If a comment is flagged by enough users it will be auto-soft-deleted. There is no penalty for this.. <i>yet</i>. Flagged comments will be surfaced to moderators, so if you have a problem with a comment, flag it.
</li>
<li>You can always delete your own comments. We are removing the ability for users with 5,000 rep to delete comments on their posts -- flagging should now be sufficient for this purpose.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
(your best comments will also show up in your user profile page, but this isn't implemented yet.)</p>
<p>
This is setting the stage for some of the comments to be visible on the page at all times, <i>without</i> having to click the comments button. Ideally, the upvoted comments (if any) will be viewed as 'best of the thread' and loaded first on the page.</p>
<p /></p></p></p>

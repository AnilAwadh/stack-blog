<p>You can't fix what you can't measure, so the first thing we did as a part of our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/07/kicking-off-the-summer-of-love/">Summer of Love</a> campaign was try to measure friendliness in an objective and repeatable way. We <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/07/week-2-of-the-summer-of-love-researching-comments/">gathered</a> 7000 comments from Stack Overflow and submitted them to Mechanical Turk. For each comment, we asked 20 people to rate the comment as Friendly, Unfriendly, or "Neutral/Unclear."</p>
<p>There are different ways of massaging the data, but I do want to give you a flavor for the kind of comments we're talking about when we're talking about unfriendly comments. Here is a snapshot of the complete results, showing comments where 95% of the reviewers rated a comment as unfriendly (warning, if there are any kids in the area, you may want to send them away):</p>

<p>Of course, "friendliness" can be subjective. But when we're talking about making Stack Overflow a friendly place, we're not talking about being terse or even snippy -- we're talking about lighting a bag of dog poo on fire and throwing it at people.</p>
<p>Of 7000 comments submitted, there were 161 that were rated as "unfriendly" by 75% or more of the reviewers… that's about 2.3%. If you browse Stack Overflow for a few minutes, it's likely that you will come across one of these extremely unfriendly comments. Of those 2.3% extremely unfriendly comments, less than 1/5th have been deleted. Most of them are still on Stack Overflow right now.</p>
<p>The "friendliness" situation is much better, mainly because our reviewers tend to universally interpret thank you's as friendly.</p>

<li>+1 This is a good question, as this programming practice is even used in some big projects. (www.ogre3D.com for ex.)</li>
<li>@Visage Haha, thanks for that</li>
<li>Great analogy, @Guffa !</li>
<li>Nice find, Chad Birch!</li>
<li>It was tagged javascript before Joel edited it. Clearly it is programming related :)</li>
<li>Thanks much for the feedback everyone</li>
<li>i wonder how did you manage to create the compoennts tag? ;) like your question +1</li>
<li>Thanks for the suggestion !</li>
<li>That's nice.  Let us know how it goes!</li>
<li>You're welcome...</li>
<li>hehe...that was fun!</li>
<li>Thanks, see my edit.</li>
<li>@Mike: Thank you.</li>
<li>Cool, will do that.</li>
<li>Okay, thanks all.</li>
<li>O_o That's very cool! +1</li>
<li>@spudly - apologies, turns out the link I posted was a dud - sorry for wasting your time!</li>
<li>Love the question.  What you're after is domain knowledge which is exactly the type of information that a company guards because it's a barrier to entry to blokes in garages writing television clients :)</li>
<li>Cool. thank you!</li>
<li>Ha! I didn't even catch it in your post. :)</li>
<li>LOVING all the images that have been added :-)</li>
<li>thanks.. thats exactly what I was looking for :)</li>
<li>Thanks everyone</li>
<li>@meagar wow that looks awesome! I'm only about a several hour drive from there, I'll see if I can make it. Juggling for the win!!! :)</li>

<p>Of 7000 comments submitted, 557 were rated as "friendly" by 75% of more of the reviewers.</p>
<p>I think this proves that the methodology is reasonably sound. I think everyone can agree that the Mechanical Turk reviewers, who were shown comments <em>out of context</em> and who probably did not know anything about our site (all they knew was that it was a "programmer's discussion forum"), did, nevertheless, produce results that seem to agree with how we, inside the community, would judge the comments. That gives me confidence that we have a reliable measure of friendliness that we can track.</p>
<p>There's a lot of other interesting stuff in the data, so here's <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/?attachment_id=12040">an Excel workbook containing the raw data and friendliness ratings</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome to Stack Exchange podcast #35 with special guest Scott Hanselman. We also have your loyal cohosts, Jay Hanlon and David Fullerton. And Joel Spolsky?</p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly would Scott say that he does here?</li>
<li>Scott Hanselman runs a podcast that doesn't waste your time… unlike we have for the first nine minutes.</li>
<li>Let's talk about Scott's recent presentation at Webstock! Or we'll talk about how Scott is <strong>not</strong> a developer evangelist, despite popular belief. He is a community manager for ASP.net, IIS, anything angle bracket or curly brace related, anything "webby".</li>
<li>You can buy a single Q-Tip or Lego lightsaber on Amazon. (Most Lego fans don't like Lego Star Wars.)</li>
<li>Why do we have both Programming.SE and Stack Overflow? Joel tells us about the historical reasoning behind it. It's a party line: Stack Overflow is for things you do at the computer, and Programmers is for things you do at the whiteboard.</li>
<li>Do people still use Twitter? We thought they'd all moved on to App.net, but that's only for people who had fifty dollars (that they didn't spend on the new iPod connector).</li>
<li>"Do you realize that you are a biscuit away from turning into Jerry Stiller?"</li>
<li>Scott works remotely. Joel inquires: how does he make that work? Scott shares some tips! (Possibly… <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/30TipsForSuccessfulCommunicationAsARemoteWorker.aspx" target="_blank">a blog post</a>?)</li>
<li>One of Scott's biggest tips is to use more face-to-face communication instead of text-based. We don't necessarily agree, and so we explore the topic in depth. Jay agrees, that debates and discussions are not productive in text-based chat.</li>
<li>Scott will probably teach Computer Science when he retires… but then, he'll be allowed to have an opinion!</li>
<li>Back on the "working remotely" topic. There's a difference between being on a distributed team and being the remote person on a not-so-distributed team. The latter is harder! Scott insists on camera at every meeting.</li>
<li>We want to spend as much as we possibly can on remote collaboration, so we talk about some of the tech you can use to accomplish that.</li>
<li>Windows 8 is coming out on Friday (or for the past year, if you are a developer or you tried to download it). How is it? Is it awesome, or did someone move everyone's cheese? Listen in to find out… and then move on to a general discussion of changing user interfaces and what that does to users who are loyal to companies.</li>
<li>Let's talk about something else that isn't twitter! Scott and Stack Exchange have in common that they provide an audience for answered questions, so Q&amp;A isn't one-on-one communication. It makes it useful for everyone. Stay tuned for the Joel Theory of Blogging. Is twitter the decline of modern blogging?</li>
<li>Joel spoke to a bunch of recruiters in London, where he told them that their job is to make the company awesome enough that great candidates come to them. Joel has a lot of projects, remarks Scott, and we discuss them - including <a href="http://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> and what makes it great, and Scott's suggestions for improvement.</li>
<li>What has everyone been doing since Joel was on the road? Some stuff we already talked about and some stuff we can't talk about yet.</li>
<li>Check out <a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/" target="_blank">This Developer's Life</a>. It's the best knock-off out there.</li>

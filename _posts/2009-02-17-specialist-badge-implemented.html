<p>
The long-awaited Specialist badges are now working; you can browse them on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/badges">the badges page</a>.</p>
<p>

<p>
After I worked with it for a while, I realized that these are just tag-based badges, so I dropped the "Specialist" name and stuck with the name of the tag as the badge name.</p>
<p>
There are two levels:</p>
<table width="300" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4">
<tr>
<td>Silver</td>
<td><b>400</b> upvotes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gold</td>
<td><b>1000</b> upvotes</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
... for <b>non-community-wiki answers</b> on questions with the specified tag.</p>
<p>
I was originally going to include community wiki answers in the calculations, as badges have historically ignored that designation. I changed my mind, however, when I saw the huge number of silver and gold "subjective", "fun", "off-topic", etc etc badges this would create. :)</p>

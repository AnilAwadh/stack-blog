<p>Last week, I went to a virtual berry tasting event.</p>
<p>Confused yet?</p>
<p>I was, too, when I first received a forwarded email invitation to a special event hosted by Driscoll’s.</p>

<p>So what was the event? <a href="http://www.driscollsmoments.com/">Driscoll’s Moments</a> was a combination cooking demo/tasting and Twitter party held on November 4. <a href="http://rickrodgers.com/rick_rodgers/rr/about-rick.html">Rick Rogers</a>, a well-known chef and food blogger, provided a cooking demonstration of five holiday recipes involving Driscoll’s raspberries. This demo took place at <a href="http://www.thekitchennyc.com/">Food Pop Studios</a> in front of a live  audience comprised mainly of food bloggers (this was what my invitation was for).</p>
<p>Simultaneously, berry fans around the country livestreamed the demo, tweeted questions and comments, and held parties of their own, featuring those same five dishes. It was a really well-organized event that did a great job bridging online and offline foodie communities, all while connecting to a brand.</p>

<p>Since I am taking over as CHAOS agent for <a href="http://www.cooking.stackexchange.com">Seasoned Advice</a>, our cooking Stack Exchange site, I attended the event to network and discuss Thanksgiving cooking issues. I got to sample a lot of food, meet some interesting people, and chat about Stack Exchange as a resource for chefs.</p>
<p>Why am I writing about this? It’s a very similar format to what we’re doing here at Stack Exchange HQ tomorrow with our <a href="http://skyrimvsmw3.com/">Skyrim v. Modern Warfare 3</a> showdown. Livestreaming? Check. Platform for Q&amp;A from the online community? Double check. Delicious food? Members of the community meeting each other in real life? Check and check.</p>
<p>Using a special event (like a holiday, or the launch of two huge games) as a way to tap into existing excitement and activity is almost a no-brainer for brands. The question is: what do you hope the impact to be? The Driscoll’s event was fun, but is there really a community of Driscoll’s fans I can continue to interact with? We hope that by introducing a crowd of gamers excited about these new releases to Stack Exchange, they will connect us with an exciting moment in their gaming lives and remember gaming.stackexchange.com as a great resource to ask *all* of their questions.</p>
<p>If you’re into Call of Duty and/or Skyrim, check out <a href="http://skyrimvsmw3.com/">http://skyrimvsmw3.com/</a> and tune in for the livestream of our launch party tomorrow. Otherwise, check back here next week to see how it went!</p>

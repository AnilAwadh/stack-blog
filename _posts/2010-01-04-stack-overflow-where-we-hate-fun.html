I noticed that the Stack Overflow question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1995113/strangest-language-feature">Strangest language feature</a> has been closed and reopened several times now. The text of the question is brief:</p>
<blockquote><p>
What is in your opinion the most surprising, weird, strange or really "WTF" language feature you have encountered?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I agree this is not exactly an ideal question for Stack Overflow, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/faq">per the FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Avoid asking questions that are subjective, argumentative, or require extended discussion</b>. This is not a discussion board, this is a place for questions that can be answered!
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I think some members of the community have gotten the idea that Stack Overflow is <i>strictly</i> business -- unless your question fits our rules exactly to a T, it is absolutely disallowed. That, <b>here on Stack Overflow, we <i>hate</i> "fun"</b>.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.threadless.com/submission/44125/The_Morning_After" style="border-bottom:none;"><img src="assets/clowns-vomit-rainbows.png" alt="" title="clowns-vomit-rainbows" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>
This is not entirely true.</p>
<p>
In my mind, there are three broad guidelines that determine whether a question is appropriate for Stack Overflow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does this question match the criteria provided in the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/faq">Stack Overflow FAQ</a>?
</li>
<li>Is this question accepted by the community, as reflected in upvotes, favorites, views, and answers?
</li>
<li>Does this question teach me anything that could make me better at my job? Can I learn something from it?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
How does the "fun" question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1995113/strangest-language-feature">Strangest language feature</a> fare?</p>
<ol>
<li>Does this question match the criteria provided in the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/faq">Stack Overflow FAQ</a>? <br />
<font color="maroon">Not really, no.</font>
</li>
<li>Is this question accepted by the community, as reflected in upvotes, views, favorites, and answers?<br />
<font color="maroon">Yes. Lots of upvotes, views, favorites, and many detailed answers</font>.
</li>
<li>Does this question teach me anything that could make me better at my job? Can I learn something from it?<br /><font color="maroon">Yes. These odd language corner cases bite programmers all the time, and the more programmers that are aware of them, the better.</font>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
As Meat Loaf once said, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=two+out+of+three+ain't+bad">two out of three ain't bad</a>. It's guideline #3 that ends up being the pivotal decision in most borderline cases.</p>
<p>
I should clarify that <b>we absolutely do not want the site overrun with "fun" questions</b>. There's no way we're sacrificing our core Q&A mission to turn into a brainless LOL-fest like Reddit or Digg. But, there is a certain balance we're trying to achieve. A world without fun is like a world without waffles and ponies. And what kind of monster would want <i>that?</i></p>
<p>
I know that we're all programmers, so we love thinking of the world in absolute, binary terms -- either fun questions must <i>never</i> be allowed, or fun questions must <i>always</i> be allowed. Well, I hate to be the one to break this to you, but the world is more &hellip; floating point. We will <i>sometimes</i> allow fun questions that meet the three broad guidelines I outlined above, but even then, <b>only a limited amount</b>.</p>
<p>
On Stack Overflow, contrary to popular opinion, we don't hate fun. But only a certain amount of fun will be tolerated, and always with steely, businesslike frowns. :)</p>

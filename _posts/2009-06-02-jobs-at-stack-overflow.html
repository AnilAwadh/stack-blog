<p>
You may have noticed we now have a <b>small job ad in the sidebar</b>:</p>
<p>
<a href="http://jobs.stackoverflow.com/" style="border-bottom:none;"><img src="assets/stack-overflow-job-ad.png" alt="stack-overflow-job-ad" title="stack-overflow-job-ad" style="border:1px solid silver;" /></a></p>
<p>
This takes you to <a href="http://jobs.stackoverflow.com">jobs.stackoverflow.com</a> or, <a href="http://jobs.serverfault.com">jobs.serverfault.com</a>. If these job boards look ... <i>familiar</i>, there's a reason.</p>
<p>
Since Joel and I are already in bed together (figuratively! <i>figuratively!</i>) it makes sense to combine our efforts in the jobs area rather than duplicate work. The last thing I wanted to do was create <b>Y</b>et <b>A</b>nother <b>J</b>ob <b>N</b>etwork. Any responsible programmer would resist this, anyway, because of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000805.html">Curly's Law</a> and DRY.</p>
<p>
I've always admired the <a href="http://jobs.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software job boards</a>, with their integrated Joel Test<sup>tm</sup>. I've referred many people there over the last few years, including my previous employer. Why not <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWMM7HPeTHQ">combine these two great tastes that taste great together</a>?</p>
<p>
So if you're looking for a gig, or you know a company that's looking for stellar programmers and/or system administrators, <b>head on over to <a href="http://jobs.stackoverflow.com">jobs.stackoverflow.com</a> or <a href="http://jobs.serverfault.com">jobs.serverfault.com</a></b>.</p>
<p>
That said, this is just a <i>start</i> on the careers front. We have some more innovative things we are working on in this area that we hope to roll out in the next 6 to 8 weeks. Like, say, wouldn't it be cool if your CV listed the stuff programmers <i>really</i> care about, such as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/102714/what-was-your-first-home-computer">your first computer</a> ... </p>
<p /></p></p></p>

<p>Dust off your tuxedo; notify the paparazzi. You are invited to the hottest ribbon-cutting ceremony this side of <a href="../2010/11/rovio-or-how-to-annoy-your-coworkers-from-200-miles-away/">Rovio</a>. Stack Exchange is launching the long-awaited <a href="http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/">Discussion Zone</a> of Area 51!</p>
<p><a href="http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/discussion-zone.png" alt="" width="206" height="94" /></a></p>
<p>The Discussion Zone is similar to a meta forum where users can bandy about proposal ideas, discuss promotions, and decide how to best mix and match these proposals into great sites. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should we merge the ___ and ___ proposals?</li>
<li>Do we really need another site about ___?</li>
<li>Would a site about ___ work in the Stack Exchange network?</li>
</ul>
<p>But there's so much more going on under the hood than a new discussion forum. The Area 51 proposals have also been organized and grouped into a series of "Categories."</p>
<h2>Area 51 Categories</h2>
<p>Categories provide more than just a cataloging system to help find interesting proposals. Categories form the basis of <strong>building communities around users with similar interests</strong>:</p>

<p>Area 51 was long overdue for a v2.0 makeover; it hasn't changed much since it <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/06/area-51-we-come-in-peace/">launched last June</a>. With almost 700 proposals vying for attention, users were having a hard time organizing and rallying around individual proposals. Some of those proposals will make great sites. But the listings are fraught with duplicates, overlapping ideas, and subsets of similar proposals -- and a few genuinely great ideas that are simply struggling to find its audience. We hope that, by creating this collaborative association, users will sort and distill the proposal list down into a collection of viable topics; proposals that need little more than the <em>time</em> to gather support.</p>
<p>The concept behind the new Area 51 design is simple…</p>
<p><a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/culture-category.png" alt="" width="595" height="326" /></a></p>
<p>Each time you visit a proposal, you should find yourself surrounded by activities of interest: related proposals, interesting discussions, like-minded users; all working together to discuss how best to create great sites from these proposal ideas.</p>
<p><a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6997" src="assets/Discussion2.png" alt="" width="273" height="216" /></a></p>
<p>Assigning Categories to proposals will also help us introduce Stack Exchange sites to proposals of interest. The added visibility will help promote the next generation of even more diverse Q&amp;A sites.</p>
<p>It's hard to predict just how these "Discussion Zone" forums will be used. They may not be the <em>silver bullet</em> that I'm hoping for. But at the very least, it gives everyone a voice.</p>

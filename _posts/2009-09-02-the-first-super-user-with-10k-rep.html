I sort of dropped the ball on this, but sometime in the last week or two, the first user <a href="http://superuser.com/users">reached 10,000 reputation on Super User</a>.</p>
<p>
That user is <a href="http://superuser.com/users/1931/john-t">John T</a>.</p>

<p>
July 15th was <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/super-user-semi-private-beta-begins/">the first day of beta</a>, and John -- as of this writing -- has 11,232 reputation. That means in about 48 days, John has produced 234 reputation per day. (Remember that bounties and accepted answers are immune to the 200/day reputation cap.)</p>
<p>
Impressive.</p>
<p>
It's all the more impressive when you realize that John is a mere 18 years old! (He's also Canadian, but I won't hold that against him.) Looks like we have another lifetime Super User on our hands. </p>
<p>
Congratulations John, and thanks for leading the charge to provide great answers on Super User!</p>

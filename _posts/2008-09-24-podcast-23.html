<p>This is the twenty-third episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and I discuss the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Stack Overflow team will be in New York City from the 24th to the 28th. It's partly business, and partly a reward to our team for their hard work on the site. <font color="red">What are some cool geeky things for us to do in NYC?</font></li>
<li>We wonder: do newscasters wear pants?</li>
<li>Joel describes his upcoming Inc. magazine article enumerating the seven development mistakes we made in building Stack Overflow. I think by seven he meant zero.</li>
<li>Most of the reviews of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cuil.com%2F&amp;ei=_4DZSJr5LomasQPA3_DsDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEAaWsxycaSfzZK4sUO3um-Nx-U2g&amp;sig2=taSQOqonltpv1GIixMSR3A">Cuil</a> and <a href="http://knol.google.com/k#">Knol</a> are negative because "I tried it for what it was intended to be used, and it didn't work."</li>
<li>The power of short informal code reviews in bridging the skill gap between beginning and expert software developers. Good developers think of this as self-preservation, because today's beginner code is tomorrow's code you'll have to maintain.</li>
<li>There have been a lot of requests for a packaged, customized version of Stack Overflow, but we have some reservations about the difficulty of delivering a packaged solution, and whether the current design will scale down to smaller private communities at all.</li>
<li>Should trusted users be allowed to close questions? Or should the community simply vote them down? I argue we need both of these methods; Joel feels we ony need voting.</li>
<li>It's ok to have some "fun" programming questions every now and then. It can't be a community if you don't stop every so often to have some (at least partially on topic) fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We also answered the following listener questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>"How do you handle newbie questions?"
</li>
<li><strong>Richard</strong>: "How do you cultivate programmer mentoring at a small company?"
</li>
</ol>

<p>We all know everyone loves pretty pictures, <a href="http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/11350/xkcd-style-graphs">chock full of graph-y goodness</a>.</p>

<p>You probably also know that about two months ago we started the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/08/stack-exchange-machine-learning-contest/">Stack Overflow Machine Learning Contest</a>, and that it's now winding down.  All models have been (or will shortly be) committed, and we're starting to gather data for the final judgement.</p>
<p>What you may not have known about was the subsidiary <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-closed-questions-on-stack-overflow/prospector">Visualization Contest</a>, which is looking to find an interesting and informative way of making sense of the mountains of interesting data in our data sets.  You're free to pull in any additional publicly available information from sources like the <a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/">Data Explorer</a> or <a href="https://api.stackexchange.com/">API</a>, but the data set put together for the machine learning contest is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Entries will be accepted through October 26th with voting ending November 1st.  We'll choose the most awesome of the top-voted entries based on how interesting and informative the visualization is, with bonus points for focusing on the subject of the machine learning contest.</p>
<p>So go out there, find a set of interesting statistics, gin up a cool picture and submit it to the...</p>

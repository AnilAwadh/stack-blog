<p>After almost three months, Apptivate - <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/09/apptivate-ms-a-windows-8-app-development-contest/">the application development contest collaboration between Stack Overflow and Microsoft</a> - has come to an end.</p>
<p>Let's get to the big news right off the bat. Congratulations to our two Apptivate.MS Grand Prize Winners: <a href="http://apptivate.ms/apps/130/piano-time">Piano Time</a> and <a href="http://apptivate.ms/apps/111/layout">Layout</a>!</p>

<p align="center" style="font-size:12px;">Congratulations to Piano Time and Layout!</p>
<p><a href="http://apptivate.ms/apps/111/layout">Layout</a> is a powerful tool for interaction design that makes prototyping in the early stages of development and design a breeze. <a href="http://apptivate.ms/apps/130/piano-time">Piano Time</a> is a multitouch piano keyboard for your Surface or other Windows 8 tablet device. (It also supports using your keyboard as, well, a keyboard.) It includes recording and playback, a metronome, a learning mode, and more.</p>
<p>As grand prize winners, these two apps win a <strong>$5,000 cash prize</strong>! They will also be featured in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/aa570311.aspx">MSDN Flash</a> and on the <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/DevRadio">DevRadio</a> show, and they will be promoted by Microsoft throughout the developer community.</p>
<p>The grand prize winners came from a pool of 15 finalists and were chosen by a panel made up of Stack Overflow's own <strong>Joel Spolsky</strong> and <strong>David Fullerton</strong>, as well as Microsoft developer evangelists <strong>Doris Chen</strong> and <strong>Jeff Brand</strong>. There was some stiff competition for the judges to choose from, and we congratulate <a href="http://apptivate.ms/semi-finals">all of our finalists</a>. They won't be going home empty-handed, either - along with the winners of the Reviewer Sweepstakes, they'll go home with some great prizes, too. The first place winners from each category group win a Surface plus a $500 cash prize. The second and third place winners go home with good stuff, too. Johnny, tell 'em what they've won!</p>

<p align="center" style="font-size:12px;">And <em>you</em> get a Surface! And <em>you</em> get a Surface! EVERYONE gets a Surface!</p>
<p>The 15 finalists came from a pool of 50 semi-finalists, which in turn came from the list of over 300 fully eligible submissions to Apptivate. Some more stats about the event:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were 456 apps submitted overall, including deleted and ineligible apps</li>
<li>The third week of November was the best week for app submission, with 49 apps coming in that week</li>
<li>Apptivate users posted 2646 questions and answers in the [windows-8] and [microsoft-metro] Stack Overflow tags</li>
<li>Over the course of the event, 3163 users voted (on apps or on comment threads) 7454 times</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all for Apptivateâ€¦ in 2012! The response to this was so positive, we're already on the lookout for similar collaborations in the new year... So stay tuned!</p>

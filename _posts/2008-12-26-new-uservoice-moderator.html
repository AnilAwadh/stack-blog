<p>
Over the last few months, I've noticed a few users that have been exceptionally active on the <a href="http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/">Stack Overflow UserVoice feedback site</a>.</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/uservoice-top-users-by-activity1.png" alt="uservoice: top users by activity" title="uservoice: top users by activity" width="524" height="165" /></p>
<p>
I have extended <b>UserVoice moderator privileges</b> to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/3043/joel-coehoorn">Joel Coehoorn</a> (it's pronounced koo-horn) and  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/106/endangeredmassa">Sean Massa</a>.</p>
<p>
I wasn't kidding when I said this in the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/faq">Stack Overflow FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
At the high end of this reputation spectrum there is little difference between users with high reputation and moderators. That is very much intentional. <b>We don't run Stack Overflow. The community does.</b>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
These two guys have gone <i>far</i> out of their way to help other users on UserVoice who have run into Stack Overflow bugs and issues. We think they've earned the right to speak as <b><a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/adjunct">adjunct</a> members</b> of the Stack Overflow team.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>adjunct</i> (adjective)</p>
<ol>
<li>Added or connected in a subordinate or auxiliary capacity: an adjunct clause.
</li>
<li>Attached to a faculty or staff in a temporary or auxiliary capacity: an adjunct professor of history.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
From now on, UserVoice responses from Sean or Joel will be similar to responses from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/about">the core team</a>. As highly active users on both Stack Overflow and UserVoice, they're in an excellent position to help, and they'll have a close dialog with us to help resolve any issues or concerns that they've identified.</p>
<p>
A big thanks to <i>everyone</i> who participates on the <a href="http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/">Stack Overflow UserVoice site</a>. I -- and I mean this quite literally -- couldn't do it without you.</p>
<p>
You can expect to see more changes on stackoverflow.com along these same lines, in the very near future.</p>

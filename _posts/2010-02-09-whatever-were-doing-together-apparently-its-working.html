We are in the enviable position of getting some very nice emails, as <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/09/i-heart-stack-overflow/">I might have mentioned before</a>. But sometimes we get emails <i>so</i> positive that I feel compelled to share them with the community.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Just wanted to commend you on the fantastic site. I have heard a little of the behind-the-scenes so I know a lot of thought has gone into it, and I really like the result-- the community feels both professional and neighborly, with folks just helping out folks. And the really nice bit is that it's a one-stop-shop for many platforms/environments, completely obsoleting my need to be on random closed mailing lists and plunge through badly threaded forum archive viewers for the stuff I care about.</p>
<p>
You've really moved the vanguard forward for tech resources. Keep up the great work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And also:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Just wanted to drop a note to the team and say thanks for building this site! It's very nearly free from a lot of things that forum/community solutions are plagued with, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folks who take "religious" positions on particular aspects of coding design, style, etc.
</li>
<li>Folks who open pointless topics such as "Is [language A] better than [language B]?"
</li>
<li>Community politics don't seem to exist
</li>
<li>You can ask a question as a n00b and people don't feel the need to call you a dolt!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I've only been using it for a few weeks, but it feels like pure, unfiltered coding question satisfaction without the baggage. I've been coding for over a decade, decided I was going to learn Ruby on Rails last month, and when I get stuck on those little questions that make me want to pull my hair out, because I know the only thing I'm missing is understanding on one or two facets of some concept, I come to the site, write a question in 5 minutes, take the dog for a walk, and by the time I come back I've either got the right answer, or something that is damn close.</p>
<p>
It's a breath of fresh air that encourages this really positive feeling in me - which makes me stop and take the time to answer others' questions, just because I find the site so damn helpful.</p>

I for one am proud to be associated with the Stack Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User communities. <b>You guys rock.</b> And not just because I said so, but because <i>every week we get emails like these in our inbox!</i></p>
<p>
As I've said before on the podcast, my favorite thing to do on any Trilogy site -- my <i>absolute favorite thing to do</i> -- is to upvote a great post by a brand new user. The "pay it forward" model of peers helping peers get better at what they do is exactly what we were shooting for.</p>
<p>
Whatever this thing is we're doing together, apparently it's working.</p>

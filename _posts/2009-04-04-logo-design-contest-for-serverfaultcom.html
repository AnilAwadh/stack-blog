Since we had such good <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/04/logo-design-contest-winner/">results</a> from our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/04/logo-design-contest/">previous community logo contest</a>, we're doing the same thing for <a href="http://serverfault.com">serverfault.com</a>:</p>
<p>
We have <a href="http://99designs.com/contests/20088">a serverfault.com logo design contest at 99 designs</a>, with a prize of $2<sup>9</sup> at stake.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://99designs.com/contests/20088" style="border-bottom:none;"><img src="assets/99-designs-logo.png" alt="99 designs logo" title="99 designs logo" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>
This time I've also <b>added $50 prizes for second and third place</b>. I always felt bad that <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/04/logo-design-contest-winner/">the logos we didn't pick for Stack Overflow</a> were so good, and I had nothing to give the designers for their effort. Luckily, our good friend Leon Bambrick stepped in at the last minute with free licenses for <a href="http://www.timesnapper.com/">TimeSnapper</a>, which was a very nice gesture. No disrespect meant to Mr. Bambrick, but I think they'll like the 50 bucks even better. :)</p>
<p>
I've noticed that a few of the logo designs that initially appeal to me are thematically matching to Stack Overflow. I like this trend!</p>
<p>
To be clear, we plan for stackoverflow.com and serverfault.com to be "sister sites", meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>they run the same underlying software
</li>
<li>they support shipping questions back and forth to each other
</li>
</ul>
<p><p>But each one will have </p>
<ul>
<li>its own community
</li>
<li>its own domain name
</li>
<li>its own set of moderators
</li>
<li>its own logo
</li>
<li>its own set of colors and visual style
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We will also have a brief (1 week?) beta period, as mentioned before, and all Stack Overflow users with > 200 rep will be invited to participate.</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p>

Geoff Dalgas, the newest member of the Stack Overflow team, shared <b>this strangely familiar error message</b> he ran into while working on another project recently.</p>

Ah yes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_overflow">the elusive stack overflow</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
In software, a stack overflow occurs when too much memory is used on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">call stack</a>. In many programming languages the call stack contains a limited amount of memory, usually determined at the start of the program. The size of the call stack depends on many factors, including the programming language, machine architecture, multi-threading, and amount of available memory. When too much memory is used on the call stack the stack is said to overflow; typically resulting in a program crash. This class of software bug is usually caused by one of two types of programming errors: <b>infinite recursion</b>, or <b>very large stack variables</b>.
</p></blockquote>

You know what'd be really ironic, though? A stack overflow on Stack Overflow. Maybe that <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000819.html">should be our 404 page</a>.</p>

Joel's vacation in France is going _so very swimmingly_ that he has declined to participate in the Stack Overflow podcast for yet another week.



![Le France](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/le-france.png)



I'm not one to judge, but **apparently Joel loves France more than he loves Stack Overflow**. I'm just sayin'.



But, maybe we can pull something together sans Joel. There are some [ideas on meta for the as-yet-unrecorded Podcast #66](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/14303/podcast-66-discussion-ideas-unofficial), so feel free to go in there and upvote or add your own.



(disclaimer: I'm just kidding, I have nothing against France. It's Australia that [really sucks](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/02/new-question-answer-rate-limits/).)

<p>
This <b>Saturday, December 19th</b>, from <b>4 PM to 8 PM PST</b>, all trilogy sites and the blog will be down for a spot of maintenance.</p>
<p>
What are we doing? A few things, several of which were inspired by comments on our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/stack-overflow-rack-glamour-shots/">Server Rack Glamour Shots</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrading one server which does a lot of VM utility work to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/whats-new.aspx">Windows Server 2008 R2</a>.
</li>
<li>Installing <a href="http://www.electronichouse.com/article/middle_atlantics_iec_power_cords_can_help_prevent_equipment_rack_mess/C30">shorter power cables</a>.
</li>
<li>Installing <a href="http://www.cat5ecableguy.com/">shorter ethernet cables</a>.
</li>
<li>Installing a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833122138">24-port gigabit switch</a>, which we will reverse 1U mount.
</li>
<li>Adding <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/blog-outage-backup-policies/">dual redundant daily USB hard drive backups</a>, as suggested by Joel.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This probably won't take 4 full hours, but we figured it was better to warn about more than we needed, just in case!</p>
<p>
All done; behold the beautiful results of Geoff's hard work -- and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/stack-overflow-rack-glamour-shots/">compare with the old setup</a>.</p>

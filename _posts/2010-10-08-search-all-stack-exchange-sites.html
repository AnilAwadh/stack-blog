<p>For as long as we've been working on Stack Overflow, we've been telling people that <b>web search is our "homepage"</b>. Just to prove it, I dug up our old <b>Project Ask Elevator Pitch</b> from <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/">FogBugz</a> -- and it's right there at the top:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/project-ask-elevator-pitch2.png" alt="Don't try to replace forums. Answer people's questions! That's our focus. Get those answers to the top of Google search so people can find the information they're looking for with a minimum of noise. How will people arrive at the site? 1) Google -- ideally directly to the question and answer." title="Don't try to replace forums. Answer people's questions! That's our focus.

<p>We've been beating this drum since the day the project began. Our goal is to make the internet better by building an engine that surfaces the <i>best</i> content to search engines.</p>
<p>Of course, searching a <i>single site</i> like Stack Overflow with Google (or your favorite web search engine) is plenty easy. We even have helpers on the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search">search page</a> to assist:</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/search-options-default-providers.png" alt="" title="search-options-default-providers" width="600" height="147" /></a></p>
<p>Doing it manually isn't hard, either; just enter the <code>site:</code> operator in front to scope your search to just a single site.</p>
<pre>
<font color="maroon">site:stackoverflow.com</font> find these words
</pre>
<p>Which is fine, but what happens when you have <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/">an (awesome) trilogy?</a> Or when you suddenly have <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">24+ (awesome) websites</a>? Then ... it's not so easy to search them all.</p>
<p>Until now!</p>
<p>We just added a custom Google search for <i>all</i> of our sites at the top of <a href="http://stackexchange.com">http://stackexchange.com</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://stackexchange.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/stack-exchange-all-site-search.png" alt="stack exchange search all sites" title="stack exchange search all sites" width="499" height="131" /></a></p>
<p>So you can now express and share network wide searches like so:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackexchange.com/search?q=the+center+cannot+hold">http://stackexchange.com/search?q=the+center+cannot+hold</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://stackexchange.com/search?q=how+do+I+back+up+my+website">http://stackexchange.com/search?q=how+do+I+back+up+my+website</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://stackexchange.com/search?q=move+the+turtle+in+logo">http://stackexchange.com/search?q=move+the+turtle+in+logo</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>... and so on.</p>
<p>We'll keep this up to date as we launch new sites, so you can <b>use your favorite search engine as the de-facto front end for all of our websites.</b></p>
<p>Exactly the way we always intended.</p>

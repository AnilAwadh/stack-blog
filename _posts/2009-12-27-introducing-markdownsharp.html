One of the things that came out of <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/10/markdown-one-year-later/">Markdown, One Year Later</a> was that we <i>really</i> needed to <b>open source our C# server-side implementation of Markdown</b>. </p>
<p>
While the client side implementation of Markdown is <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/wmd-editor-reverse-engineered/">already open sourced</a>, there are two sides to the Markdown story on Stack Overflow -- what appears in the Javascript preview on the client, and what is rendered in C# on the server and ultimately stored in the database. While we are trying to normalize the client and server implementation over time -- I've made significant progress in the last two weeks in doing so -- there are inevitably small differences that creep in over time. It would be nice to have more eyeballs on this process to assist.</p>
<p>
Since <a href="http://aspnetresources.com/blog/markdown_announced.aspx">the original C# library we used for Markdown</a> was not open source, this was a problem. I mailed the author, <a href="http://aspnetresources.com/">Milan Negovan</a>, and he granted copyright to me.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Hi there, guys!</p>
<p>
Sure, I don’t mind at all. I’ve always wanted the community to improve and contribute to its development, but never found the proverbial bandwidth to run the project that way.</p>
<p>
Cheers!<br />
Milan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, <b>I've released our C# implementation of Markdown under a proper open source license</b> -- as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/">MarkdownSharp</a>!</p>
<p>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/" style="border-bottom:none"><img src="assets/markdown-sharp-logo.png" alt="markdown-sharp-logo" title="markdown-sharp-logo" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/">http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/</a></p>
<p>
I've already made a few changes to properly package it as a decent open source project:</p>
<ul>
<li>included relevant links, documentation, and related files
</li>
<li>added MDTest 1.1 test suite
</li>
<li>added Simple test suite
</li>
<li>both NUnit and console runnable tests
</li>
<li>standard Benchmark with short, medium, and long Markdown samples
</li>
<li>refactored and profiled for 2x - 5x more performance
</li>
<li>the Stack Overflow specific changes (such as stricter italics/bold) are configurable, so you can toggle them on and off.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
One nice side effect of this process is that I've been able to incorporate <a href="http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/source/list">quite a few bug fixes</a>, some of them fairly serious. The <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/12694/escaping-backticks-fails">failure to escape backticks</a> was a big one, and there was a subtle <a href="http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/source/detail?r=20">bug involving a single character of whitespace</a> that caused all &lt;hr/&gt;s to be wrapped in paragraph tags since.. well, forever.</p>
<p>
Anyway, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/">take a look at the project</a>, feel free to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/source/browse/">browse the source</a>, and <b>please contribute whatever you can to make it better for everyone</b>.</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p>

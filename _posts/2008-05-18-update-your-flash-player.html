I noticed that a few people have had trouble with the embedded flash podcast player in the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/index.php/category/podcasts/">podcast posts</a>. They reported that Joel and I sounded like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_and_the_Chipmunks">chipmunks</a>. </p>
<p>
I was able to duplicate this problem using a virtual machine and a stock version of Windows XP. If you're having the chipmunk playback problem, <b>you have an out-of-date installation of Adobe Flash</b>. That's the cause.</p>
<p>
I strongly recommend <a href="http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash">Updating your Flash Player</a> to the latest version. Bear in mind, if you regularly use more than one browser, you must update Flash individually for each browser you use.</p>
<p>
If you're wondering what version of Flash you have installed, use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/about/">the official Adobe online Flash version number checker</a>. It's reporting I have version 9.0.115.0 installed at the moment.</p>
<p>
Updating Flash isn't just a good idea to correct the playback issues with our podcast audio player -- it's also a good idea because <a href="http://www.cnet.com/8301-13554_1-9837179-33.html">there are serious security vulnerabilities in old versions of Flash</a>, too. If your Flash is version 9.0.48.0 or earlier, you're subject to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb07-20.html">at least 9 critical security vulnerabilities according to Adobe!</a> And remember, these are the worst kinds of vulnerabilities -- the ones that can compromise your system by <i>simply visiting the wrong web page</i>. Scary stuff.</p>
<p>
Let's practice safe computing and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash">get that Flash player updated!</a></p>

<p><a href="http://tirania.org/blog/">Miguel De Icaza</a> joins Jeff &amp; Joel this week to discuss everything from Miguel's many projects to identity on the internet to playdates for toddlers.  Miguel is a force in the software world, having initiated and contributed to all kinds of products over the years - he's also well known for being one of the most productive programmers out there.  Check out the full episode for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Miguel has worked on a number of different projects including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander">Midnight Commander</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME">Gnome</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_%28software%29">Mono</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ximian">Ximian</a> and more</li>
<li>Midnight Commander still continues to be developed to this day (albeit by other people) and it has some interesting new features that have been added</li>
<li>Joel reiterates his <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000059.html">hate for huge numbers of configuration options</a> and appreciates Miguel not implementing ridiculous option trees in his programs</li>
<li>We have a brand new podcasting setup (again!) - keep your eyes open for an upcoming post detailing our whole setup</li>
<li>Jeff thinks that Unix couldn't make the same advances as some other systems (like Apple) because they didn't have a dictator to force massive changes on the community</li>
<li>After leaving Novell (which owns Mono), he <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/May-16.html">launched a new company</a> (<a href="http://xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a>) that is working on some new projects, while also supporting the existing Mono community</li>
<li>Cross platform apps are stupid if they aren't coded using the native UX and tools (see Word 5 for Mac, Safari for Windows, etc) which makes them look different from every other program on that platform</li>
<li>Make sure to check out <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com">Area51</a> to see all of the new sites that are currently in commitment and under consideration of being launched.  Support the proposals that you want to see as Stack Exchange sites!</li>
<li>Our new <a href="http://bicycles.stackexchange.com">Bicycles</a> site just launched as a full site (and gotten its own theme)!</li>
<li>We've started a new team of people (<a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/100137/what-is-the-meaning-of-chaos-is-it-related-to-the-psi-character">CHAOS</a>) who will help enhance and promote many of our communities - the first project they are working on is enhancing question titles and converting many of them into actual questions</li>
<li>This has also led to a big debate internally over the relationship between great questions and titles and what guidelines we should set for making titles</li>
<li>Miguel is the most productive person that Joel knows (besides <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0290556/">James Franco</a>)</li>
<li>We have <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/stack-exchange-site-newsletters/">a new newsletters feature</a> that allows you to get a weekly newsletter showing the top and most interesting questions from sites that you're interested in but don't visit every day.  Check out <a href="http://stackexchange.com/newsletters">stackexchange.com/newsletters</a> - it's like a candy store filled with free candy!</li>
<li>Sometimes people tell us they are interested in certain topics but their activity tells us something different (which is why we auto customize the homepage for each user) - its kinda similar to people on dating sites...</li>
<li>Every once in a while, we have a site that makes it through Area51 despite it "sucking" (eg: freelancers) - the problem with these sites is that there simply aren't enough questions because its too small a topic - the entire topic can be covered in one book</li>
<li>There are two current proposals that present an interesting contrast on this topic: <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/11655/christianity">Christianity</a> and <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1817/biblical-hermeneutics">Biblical Hermeneutics</a> - the biblical site has great, specific questions, where's Christianity doesn't and will likely be a weak site</li>
<li>Cross "Joel tells an army story" off your <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/stack-overflow-podcast-bingo/">Stack Exchange Podcast Bingo Card</a>!</li>
<li>Coming soon: use as many OpenID logins as you want on SE (instead of the current limit of two)</li>
<li>One of our developers (Kevin Montrose) wrote a great blog post on how <a href="http://kevinmontrose.com/2011/07/31/your-email-is-practically-your-identity/">your email is your identity</a></li>
<li>Fair warning: Miguel lies a lot <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/migueldeicaza">on his twitter feed</a></li>
<li>Make sure you get your tickets for <a href="http://devdays.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow DevDays</a> (we just <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/documenting-devdays-2011-2-%E2%80%93-speakers/">announced the first round of speakers</a> for all the cities!) and use discount code "podcast" to save $100!</li>
</ul>
<p>Join us next week for another live episode on Tuesday @ 4pm (EDT) or catch the posted version on Wednesday.</p>

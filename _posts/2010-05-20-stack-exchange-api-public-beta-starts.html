Our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/03/stack-overflow-api-private-beta-starts/">API private beta</a> is coming to an end, which means <b>it's time for the API public beta to start</b>.</p>
<p>
We've set up a dedicated site to support the public beta at ...</p>
<p><h2><a href="http://stackapps.com">stackapps.com</a></h2>
<p>
It's called Stack Apps because, well, that's what it is -- a place for <b>applications</b> that run on our "Stack". You can either find existing apps that are already out there, or learn how to write your own apps.</p>
<p>
We're calling it the <b>Stack Exchange API</b> because our API isn't tied to Stack Overflow -- it's designed to work on <i>all</i> current <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/">Trilogy</a> sites as well as <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/post/518474918/stack-exchange-2-0">all future Stack Exchange websites we launch</a>, too.</p>
<p>
What can you do on <a href="http://stackapps.com">Stack Apps</a>?</p>
<ul>
<li>Find <a href="http://stackapps.com/?tab=apps">applications, wrappers, and libraries that use our API</a> -- or list your own
</li>
<li>Browse <a href="http://stackapps.com/questions/tagged/faq">the FAQs</a> to learn how the API works
</li>
<li>Provide feedback on and vote for the applications listed here
</li>
<li><a href="http://stackapps.com/apps/register">Get an API key</a>
</li>
<li>Ask questions about how the API works
</li>
<li>Tell us about bugs or problems with the API
</li>
<li>Suggest improvements to the API
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Fair warning, though, this is still a <u>beta</u>, albeit a public and more stable beta.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Version 1 is read only</b>. Coming up with a solid API is hard enough without adding writing and authentication to the mix. For the initial release, it’s a read-only API. We’ll take on the much more challenging problem of writing (and authentication) in v2.
</li>
<li><b>The API may change during the public beta</b>. While we expect far, far less breakage than we had during the <i>private</i> beta, the intent of this public beta is to keep improving the API, so there may be changes. We want the API polished up for a formal "locked in" V1.0 release about 2 months from now.
</li>
<li><b>If you build to our API, we will support you</b>. We'll be on <a href="http://stackapps.com">Stack Apps</a> daily helping out in any way we can, and listening to all your feedback. If you're contributing your valuable time building an app on our API, the least we can do is provide a stable platform for you to build on. We plan to have a solid 1.0 API that is reliable and supported for a very long time. That's a promise.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you're interested in <b>applications that run on all current and future Stack-engined based sites, please participate in the public Stack Exchange API beta</b>. Visit <a href="http://stackapps.com">Stack Apps</a>, see what you think, and give us your feedback. Help us create an API that doesn't suck!</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p></p>

<p>Jeff &amp; Joel are back with guests this week - joining them are <a href="http://serverfault.com/users/2561/kyle-brandt">Kyle Brandt</a> and <a href="http://serverfault.com/users/5880/zypher">George Beech</a>, our very own sysadmins/ops guys/[insert your own term here]</p>
<p>After a brief test of the emergency broadcast system, we plunge right into the podcast, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joel is late because he had to go up to AOL HQ to pick up some more floppy disks for the office</li>
<li>We recently <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/blog-overflow/">launched Blog Overflow </a>- which was actually a pretty substantial engineering and technical background to making it happen.</li>
<li>A huge discussion of the the SE infrastructure setup and why we host our own instead of relying on Amazon or another outside provider.  Hint: not only can we roll our own better, <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/73969/what-would-stack-exchanges-yearly-expenses-be-if-it-were-to-be-using-a-third-par/73978#73978">but its a lot cheaper too</a>.</li>
<li>In the department of little tweaks with big effect, check out our "network apocalypse": at one point, Stack reconfigured to separate different types of network traffic due to <a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/post/per-second-measurements-dont-cut-it/">microbursting</a> overloading the network - this simple upgrade greatly increased the throughput and efficiency of the existing infrastructure.</li>
<li>In the good news department: Jeff talks about the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/09/expanding-user-cards/">expanding user cards</a> just introduced and based on a conversation from our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/se-podcast-15/">podcast a few weeks ago</a> with <a href="http://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/1393/michael-at-herbivoracious">Michael Natkin</a></li>
<li>In the bad news department: we've decided to cancel Stack Overflow DevDays due to low ticket sales - you can read <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/09/devdays-2011-is-cancelled/">Joel's full blog post</a> for all the details.</li>
<li>Finally, we welcome our newest engineering hire - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/85785/mythz">Demis</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it!  Tune in next week at the usual time for another episode with more guests!</p>

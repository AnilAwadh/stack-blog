Andela is a great compaany.\n\nLast year, I attended a hackathon organised by them - my first experience of such an event having watched many hackathons over Youtube.\n\nWhat that organisation is doing in Africa, specifically Nigeria, is that they are essentially fostering the development of an ecosystem of 'hackers', and that is truely remarkable. We need more organisations like this in Africa, so I commend the Andela team.\n\nI must say I am really impressed by their fast-paced growth. Go Andela!"}, {"author_name": "Doorknob", "gravatar_hash": "bf5ae1189f8b36ece8fcdc2e2e761104", "author_url": "http://keyboardfire.com", "date": "2015-05-27 15:12:04", "message": "It never ceases to amaze me how many awesome things Stack Exchange does.

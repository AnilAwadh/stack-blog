They should be supplementary, never primary.  The question content (title and body) should stand alone without any additional data residing only in tags.   Thus, in a list of titles, all of the pertinent data about a question should be encapsulated in titles alone.  If you need to rely on tags to clarify what the titles are referring to, there's a problem."}, {"author_name": "click_whir", "gravatar_hash": "16d2a8e7909baef0b22dc4f6ebd31be9", "author_url": null, "date": "2013-05-14 17:51:14", "message": "I was at the event.

It does indicate massive interest, but whether the interest will actually get translated into activity is hard to say.

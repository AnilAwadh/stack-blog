	<itunes:summary>Hosted by Joel Spolsky with Jay Hanlon and David Fullerton, the Stack Exchange podcast lets you listen in on discussions and decisions about the Stack Exchange Network. The Stack Exchange podcast gives you an unparalleled view into how a startup is created and built.

About Stack Exchange:
Stack Exchange is a fast-growing network of over 100 question and answer sites on diverse topics from software programming to cooking to photography and gaming. We are an expert knowledge exchange: a place where physics researchers can ask each other about quantum entanglement, computer programmers can ask about JavaScript date formats, and photographers can share knowledge about taking great pictures in the snow.</itunes:summary>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The core goal of Stack Exchange is education. Everything we build is geared toward helping people learn from one another &#8212; not just the nuts and bolts of their profession or passion, but the universal skills of how to better communicate and learn. As we&#8217;ve grown as a company, we&#8217;ve benefited from many resources to assist in educating developers out of our office space, including hosting <a href="http://www.meetup.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/events/206151292/">local meetups</a> and partnering with the Flatiron School and Fog Creek for a <a href="http://blog.flatironschool.com/post/107229276393/fog-creek-and-the-nyc-web-development-fellowship">mentorship program</a>.</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce our partnership with the <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/forward/initiatives/tech-talent.page">New York City Tech Talent Pipeline</a>, Mayor de Blasio’s new initiative designed to increase the number of qualified candidates for open tech positions in New York City.</p>
<p><image width="640" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TRXOC.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display:block"></p>
<h2>That’s nice. But how?</h2>
<p>The city has brought together <a href="http://www.techtalentpipeline.nyc/">a number of major companies that hire developers in NYC</a> and asked us to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Join a committee designed to help the city identify ways it can use its resources to attack the problem more broadly (through the education system, etc.), and</li>
<li>Implement programs we can run, possibly with the help and support of other awesome like-minded tech companies in the city.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the first point, we’re excited that our VP of Engineering, David Fullerton, will be sitting in on quarterly meetings with other tech industry leaders convened by Mayor de Blasio, where we hope we can help to represent the developer voice and to share what skills and technologies we know are most in-demand.</p>
<p>For the second, we’ve already brought in a bunch of (awesome) NYC companies &#8212; including Trello, Kickstarter, Foursquare, Tumblr, and Control Group &#8212; who will build and teach a new curriculum of programmer “soft skills” to graduates of public computer science programs in New York (starting with the CUNY system) that will better equip them as professional developers.</p>
<p>The goal is to make sure that anyone in this city with a passion for technology, no matter who they are or what neighborhood they grew up in, can get the mentoring, training, and support they need to succeed as a developer.</p>
<h2>Why are <i>we</i> doing this?</h2>
<p>As you probably know, there’s a vast disparity between open tech jobs and qualified developers in today’s market. At last count, there are <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/12/31/hiring-and-hirable-in-2013-agile-developers/">nearly 5 job openings</a> for every one job-seeking developer. With New York City’s current tech job count teetering at around 300,000 job openings, we need to increase the number of good candidates or a lot of  websites aren’t going to get built. The city needs developers. And this happens to be an area that we know a thing or two about. Our goal is to support and empower developers, no matter where they may be in their programming careers. Despite our well-known <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/02/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/">belief in remote work</a>, our founder has always been a particular proponent of building great places in New  York for those developers who <i>do </i><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/01/why-we-still-believe-in-private-offices/">want to work in a more communal space</a>. Like many tech companies, we’ve been giving a lot of thought to how we can promote inclusion, both internally and in the tech community as a whole. We don’t pretend to have figured it all out, but this is just one thing we’re excited to share. As always, we welcome any ideas you may have.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #404040;">Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast #62, recorded live on January 20th&#8211;with a <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19636047#19636047">live studio audience (kinda)!</a>. Today&#8217;s podcast was brought to you by the American Venture Capital Association. With you today are our hosts Jay Hanlon, David Fullerton, and Joel Spolsky.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s jump right in: we made <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/01/andreessen-horowitz-invests-in-stack-exchange/">a big announcement</a>! Andreessen Horowitz has invested a pile of money in our little company so we can improve our &#8216;programmer forums&#8217;. Precisely none of the pile of money is going into Jay&#8217;s raise, but one of those dollars <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19637567#19637567" title="there's a spider hidden in George Washington's hair">is going to SomeKittens</a>.</p>
<p>So, the (forty) million dollar question: <b><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19637602#19637602">how are we going to use this money</a>?</b>
<div style="float:right; margin:0 6px 0 6px; text-align:center"><i><small>(not on supporting ancient browsers.)</small></i><br /><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19637817#19637817"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gHEFZ.gif" width="200"></a></div>
<p>We intend to (continue) spending money on <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow Careers</a>. Our goal is to <strong>get every programmer a better job</strong>, and we want to do that without selling crazy-takeover-animated-bonzaibuddy-ads that feel like reading a newspaper on the subway (according to Joel), so we&#8217;re getting money from investors instead.</p>
<p>How are we going to make this happen? We plan to revisit the developer side of the Careers equation and figure out how to make that better. More features to let programmers search and filter for interesting jobs, update the way profiles work, etc. &#8211; more of the stuff we were going to work on anyway. Careers is already a very developer-focused product: we limit the things our employers can do heavily based on what drives programmers nuts. For example, we only let employers contact a limited number of candidates <i>unless those candidates actually respond</i>, and we disallow contingency recruiters. (A pox on all of their houses.) </p>
<p>You can get a Careers profile <a href="https://careers.stackoverflow.com/cv/get-one">here</a>. We filter the applications to make sure only real programmers end up with profiles on Careers.</p>
<p>Time to take some questions from the peanut gallery!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/512?m=19637808#19637808"><strong>How will this [investment news] affect the sites?</strong></a><br />
Not one bit!</p>
<p>Well, a few bits. This cash will allow us to hire more designers, so more sites can graduate and get beautiful site designs. We&#8217;ll get to hire more people to hit more of our goals at the same time. For example, one of the things we&#8217;re actively working on now is <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/277584/feedback-requested-search-engine-usage">improving search</a> on Q&amp;A sites.</p>
<p>Have we mentioned lately that <a href="http://stackexchange.com/about/hiring">we&#8217;re hiring</a>? Our most urgent need is for product managers, and you can apply for that job even if you&#8217;ve never had &#8216;product manager&#8217; in your job title before.
</li>
<li><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/512?m=19638446#19638446"><strong>Will there be someone to represent the rage quitters?</strong></a><br />
Yes. You&#8217;re hired. Thanks for volunteering.
</li>
<li><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/512?m=19637981#19637981"><strong>Would you consider being an intermediary, putting a &#8220;Buy This Person&#8217;s Time&#8221; on their profile page or answers?</strong></a><br />
No! (Sorry, <a href="http://brentozar.com/">Brent</a>.)
</li>
<li><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19637973#19637973"><strong>Has the Stack Overflow design update changed user behavior?</strong></a><br />
We&#8217;ve noticed a big uptick in the number of people complaining about how blue and cream go together. We&#8217;ve also gotten a lot of <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/tags/design">constructive feedback on meta</a> that we&#8217;ve used to inform tweaks (but it&#8217;s really hard to distinguish those from comments about how people&#8217;s cheese has been moved).
</li>
<li><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19638186#19638186"><strong>Can you comment on whether SO rep is useful to a job search?</strong></a><br />
Lots of employers out there don&#8217;t know what Stack Overflow is, but Joel is going to use some of those 40 million dollars to educate them. But from our perspective, posting on Stack Overflow is more like blogging in that it can tell you a lot about a programmer and how they interact with the developer community. Stack Overflow reputation <em>alone</em> doesn&#8217;t always tell you about the second half of &#8220;smart and gets things done&#8221;.
</li>
<li><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19638845#19638845"><strong>Will you be making a Windows Phone app?</strong></a><br />
Not for the foreseeable future. This question <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19638851#19638851">makes our mobile lead sad</a>.
</li>
<li><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19638237#19638237"><strong>Are there any plans to add a chat feature to the mobile application?</strong></a><br />
(Mobile lead Kasra just dropped dead.) We may add chat to the mobile app yet, but it&#8217;s not in our 2015 plan.
</li>
<li><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19638594#19638594"><strong>Are we going to ever allow wildcards in searches? Currently in chat it just nulls the search.</strong></a><br />
Chat search is weird and backwards, but actual site search allows a certain amount of wildcards. This will get a better response if you post it <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/">on Meta</a> and our search devs can actually respond!</li>
<li><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19639079#19639079"><strong>What happened to the videos idea?</strong></a><br />
We first thought about <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/270574/an-experiment-stack-overflow-tv">Stack Overflow TV</a> a while back. We hope to expand into areas of developer learning beyond questions and answers someday, and SOTV is one of those ideas. It will essentially be a YouTube channel with little introductory videos on topics in programming. The idea has hit some snags, but it&#8217;s still on our radar.
</li>
<li><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/19639168#19639168"><strong>Do you have any plans to run hackathons to promote local user groups?</strong></a><br />
Yes! On a small scale, we make our office space available to local user groups who need a place to meet.
</li>
</ul>
<p>And we&#8217;re out of questions. So what else is going on these days? <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/12/winter-bash-2014/">Hats!</a> And some <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites?view=list#newest">new sites</a>. How about new features? We&#8217;re experimenting with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review/triage">a new triage queue</a> to help sort questions into &#8220;hopeless and needs to be burninated&#8221; and &#8220;could be passable with some editing&#8221; buckets. Things in the triage queue won&#8217;t show up on the homepage until they&#8217;ve been approved. <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/278380/help-us-test-question-triage">Here are the details</a>.</p>
<p>Joel wants to sign off, but first make sure you check out <a href="http://expressionengine.stackexchange.com/">Expression Engine SE&#8217;s new design</a>. (Since this podcast was recorded, <a href="http://movies.stackexchange.com/">Movies SE</a> has also graduated with a slick new theme.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stack Overflow Careers was announced <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/10/introducing-stack-overflow-careers/">five years ago</a> with a simple mission statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe that <strong>every professional programmer should have a job they love</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>To help you find a job you love, we need to match you with the right job at the right time. We do that by <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/careers-2-0-launches/">helping you create a profile that brings the right employers to you</a>, and by showing you relevant job ads from our <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs">job board</a> on Stack Overflow. With <a href="https://careers.stackoverflow.com/companies">over 6,000 companies</a> that advertise on Stack Overflow Careers, we&#8217;re getting closer to our goal of having a great job for every developer.</p>
<p>Until today, the job ads that we show on Stack Overflow were pretty stupid: they targeted solely based on location, and ignored all the other information about what you&#8217;re looking for and what kind of job it is. They didn&#8217;t even care about whether the job was in a technology that you were interested in. So today* we&#8217;re launching the first step in showing you jobs that we think are an actual match for you.</p>
<p><em><sub>*If you just ran to a question to see how targeted the jobs were and left disappointed, don’t worry. This feature is just launching today and most employers haven’t had a chance to target their jobs yet. You’ll see the difference over the coming months.</sub></em></p>
<h2 style="margin: 2em 0 1em;">Developer Types, Tech Ecosystems, and Tech Tags</h2>
<p>Many of you will start noticing that the jobs you see aren’t just in your area, but are related to the question you’re viewing, a question you’ve answered, or something you’ve asked about. We’re using this little bit of data, along with the location data we were already using, to predict what type of job you’re more likely to want to apply to. We then do some <a href="http://kevinmontrose.com/2015/01/27/providence-machine-learning-at-stack-exchange/">predictive modeling </a>based on this information to target mobile jobs at mobile devs, front-end web development jobs at front-end devs, and even more complex stuff based on technology stack and specific tags.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to show you an example of a targeted ad. We haven’t changed much about the ad design or even how the job is displayed in the ads. However, we <i>can</i> show you the other side, how the employer is targeting their jobs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8oSNi.png"><img style="width: 80%;" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8oSNi.png" alt="Targeting-Overview" /></a></p>
<p>This is all organized into three tiers of targeting criteria:</p>

<p>It’s really that simple. Once employers fill out a targeting profile for a job, we’ll try and predict which of those jobs you’ll be interested in.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 2em 0 1em;">Fine, but these are just ads. Why should I care?</h2>
<p>Hopefully this doesn’t change much about how you use Stack Overflow in your daily life. Job ads are only a small part of our page content, but we hope this launch will improve your odds of seeing the right job opportunity at the right time. So far it appears to be working. Initial testing of targeted jobs over the past few months have demonstrated significant progress toward our goal of showing relevant job ads to each developer, as clickthrough rates increased 21-30%. Not bad for a V1!</p>
<p>We also want to let you know exactly how we’re targeting jobs, so our newly created data team will be talking about building out the infrastructure for this project, and all the details of what went into it. You can follow these posts on <a href="http://kevinmontrose.com/2015/01/27/providence-machine-learning-at-stack-exchange/">Kevin Montrose’s blog</a> starting today. <a href="http://jasonpunyon.com">Jason Punyon</a> will also be adding to this series later this week and next.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you want to see your personal prediction data, or if you want to disable predictions, you can do that from the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/prediction-data">user preferences page</a>.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 2em 0 1em;">This sounds cool; I want to use it to hire a developer!</h2>
<p>If you want more details on how this works for employers, go visit our <a href="http://blog.careers.stackoverflow.com/2015/01/27/hiring-developers-just-got-easier-with-our-new-targeting-feature/">Stack Overflow Careers blog</a>. If you want to dive right in, you can post a job now and <a href="https://careers.stackoverflow.com/products/listings/?utm_source=careers-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=careers-blog-product-pages-targeting#targeting">fill out a targeting profile</a>. And if you already have a job running, you can edit it to add targeting for the rest of its run.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! As always, if you have questions or comments feel free to post on <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/careers">Meta Stack Exchange in the &#8216;Careers&#8217; tag</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>(Note: This is a <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/items/2015/01/20.html">cross post</a> from <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com">Joel on Software</a>). </p></blockquote>
<p><H2>Stack Exchange Raises $40m</H2></p>
<p>Today <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> is pleased to announce that we have raised $40 million, mostly from <a href="http://a16z.com/">Andreessen Horowitz</a>.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to know what we’re going to do with all that money. First of all, of course we’re going to gold-plate the Aeron chairs in the office. Then we’re going to upgrade the game room, and we’re already sending lox platters to our highest-rep users.</p>
<p>But I’ll get into that in a minute. First, let me catch everyone up on what’s happening at Stack Exchange.</p>
<p>In 2008, <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/">Jeff Atwood</a> and I set out to fix a problem for programmers. At the time, getting answers to programming questions online was super annoying. The answers that we needed were hidden behind paywalls, or buried in thousands of pages of stale forums.</p>
<p>So we set out to build <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> with a single-minded, compulsive, fanatical obsession with serving programmers by building a better Q&amp;A site.</p>
<p>Everything about how Stack Overflow works today was designed to make programmers’ jobs easier. We let members vote up answers, so we can show you the best answer first. We don’t allow opinionated questions, because they descend into flame wars that don’t help people who need an answer right now. We have scrupulously avoided any commercialization of our editorial content, because we want to have a site that programmers can trust.</p>
<p>Heck, we don’t even allow animated ads, even though they are totally standard on every other site on the Internet, because it would be disrespectful to programmers to strain their delicate eyes with a dancing monkey, and we can’t serve them 100% if we are distracting them with a monkey. That would only be serving them 98%. And we’re OBSESSED, so 98% is like, we might as well close this all down and go drive taxis in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Anyway, it worked! Entirely thanks to you. An insane number of developers stepped up to pass on their knowledge and help others. Stack Overflow quickly grew into the largest, most trusted repository of programming knowledge in the world.</p>
<p>Quickly, Jeff and I discovered that serving programmers required more than just code-related questions, so we built <a href="http://serverfault.com/">Server Fault</a> and <a href="http://superuser.com/">Super User</a>. And when that still didn’t satisfy your needs, we set up <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> so the community could create sites on new topics. Now when a programmer has to set up a server, or a PC, or a database, or Ubuntu, or an iPhone, they have a place to go to ask those questions that are full of the people who can actually help them do it.</p>
<p>But you know how programmers are. They “have babies.”&nbsp; Or “take pictures of babies.” So our users started building Stack Exchange sites on unrelated topics, like <a href="http://parenting.stackexchange.com/">parenting</a> and <a href="http://photo.stackexchange.com/">photography</a>, because the programmers we were serving expected—nay, demanded!—a place as awesome as Stack Overflow to ask about baby feeding schedules and f-stops and whatnot.</p>
<p>And we did such a good job of serving programmers that a few smart non-programmers looked at us and said, “Behold! I want that!” and we thought, hey!&nbsp; What works for developers should work for a lot of other people, too, as long as they’re willing to think like developers, which is the best way to think. So, we decided that anybody who wants to get with the program is welcome to join in our plan. And these sites serve their own communities of, you know, <a href="http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/">bicycle mechanics</a>, or what have you, and make the world safer for the Programmer Way Of Thinking and thus serve programmers by serving bicycle mechanics.</p>
<p>In the five years since then, our users have built 133 communities. Stack Overflow is still the biggest. It reminds me of those medieval maps of the ancient world. The kind that shows a big bustling city (Jerusalem) smack dab in the middle, with a few smaller settlements around the periphery. (Please imagine Gregorian chamber music).</p>
<div id="attachment_15289" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Jerusalem.jpg"><img src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Jerusalem-300x212.jpg" alt="View of Jerusalem" width="300" height="212" class="size-medium wp-image-15289" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">View of Jerusalem</p></div>
<p>Stack Overflow is the big city in the middle. Because the programmer-city worked so well, people wanted to ask questions about other subjects, so we let them build other Q&amp;A villages in the catchment area of the programmer-city. Some of these Q&amp;A villages became cities of their own. The <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/">math</a> <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/">cities</a> barely even have any programmers and they speak their own weird language. They are math-Jerusalem. They make us very proud. Even though they don’t directly serve programmers, we love them and they bring a little tear to our eyes, like the other little villages, and they’re certainly making the Internet—and the world—better, so we’re devoted to them.</p>
<p>One of these days some of those villages will be big cities, so we’re committed to keeping them clean, and pulling the weeds, and helping them grow.</p>
<p>But let’s go back to programmer Jerusalem, which—as you might expect—is full of devs milling about, building the ENTIRE FUTURE of the HUMAN RACE, because, after all, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">software is eating the world</a>&nbsp;and writing software is just writing a script for how the future will play out.</p>
<p>So given the importance of software and programmers, you might think they all had wonderful, satisfying jobs that they love.</p>
<p>But sadly, we saw that was not universal. Programmers often have crappy jobs, and their bosses often poke them with sharp sticks. They are underpaid, and they aren’t learning things, and they are sometimes overqualified, and sometimes underqualified. So we decided we could actually make all the programmers happier if we could move them into better jobs.</p>
<p>That’s why we built <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow Careers</a>. This was the first site that was built for developers, not recruiters. We banned the scourge of contingency recruiters (even if they have big bank accounts and are just LINING UP at the Zion Gate trying to get into our city to feed on programmer meat, but, to hell with them). We are SERVING PROGRAMMERS, not spammers. Bye Felicia.</p>
<p><strong>Which brings us to 2015.</strong></p>
<p>The sites are still growing like crazy. By our measurements, the Stack Exchange network is already in the top 50 of all US websites, ranked by number of unique visitors, with traffic still growing at 25% annually. The company itself has passed 200 employees worldwide, with big plush offices in Denver, New York, and London, and dozens of amazing people who work from the comfort of their own homes. (By the way, if 200 people seems like a lot, keep in mind that more than half of them are working on Stack Overflow Careers).</p>
<p>We could just slow down our insane hiring pace and get profitable right now, but it would mean foregoing some of the investments that let us help more developers. To be honest, we literally can’t keep up with the features we want to build for our users. The code is not done yet—we’re dedicating a lot of resources to the core Q&amp;A engine. This year we’ll work on improving the experience for both new users and highly experienced users.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget Stack Overflow Careers. I believe it is, bar-none, the single best job board for developer candidates, which should&nbsp; automatically make it the best place for employers to find developer talent. There’s a LOT more to be done to serve developers here and we’re just getting warmed up.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Scent.png"><img src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Scent.png" alt="Scent" width="635" height="345" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15291" /></a></p>
<p>So that’s why we took this new investment of $40m.</p>
<p>We’re ecstatic to have Andreessen Horowitz on board. The partners there believe in our idea of programmers taking over (it was Marc Andreessen who coined the phrase “Software is eating the world”). Chris Dixon has been a personal investor in the company since the beginning and has always known we’d be the obvious winner in the Q&amp;A category, and will be joining our board of directors as an observer.</p>
<p>This is not the first time we’ve raised money; we’re proud to have previously taken investments from Union Square Ventures, Index Ventures, Spark Capital, and Bezos Expeditions. We only take outside money when we are 100% confident that the investors share our philosophy completely and after our lawyers have done a ruthless (sorry, investors) job of maintaining control so that it is literally impossible for anyone to mess up our vision of fanatically serving the people who use our site, and continuing to make the Internet a better place to get expert answers to your questions.</p>
<p>For those of you who have been with us since the early days of Our Incredible Journey, thank you. For those of you who are new, welcome.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a time where it seemed like we barely even needed to talk about this: Joel had <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/07/30.html">won the argument</a>, the Internet agreed that private offices were the future, and only incompetent management (or a tight budget) was still putting developers in cubicle farms. A glorious future lay before us.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%"><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BionicOffice.html"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/1qD5w.png" alt="" /></a><br />
<em>The original Fog Creek <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BionicOffice.html">Bionic Office</a>, way back in ye olde 2003. We <br/>didn&#8217;t have iPhones, but at least the offices had doors.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, that’s not quite how it turned out. Open plans have been surprisingly hard to kill, despite research showing that they’re <a href="http://www.dezeen.com/2014/11/21/open-plan-office-designs-unpopular-with-workers-damage-productivity/">unpopular</a>, <a href="http://eab.sagepub.com/content/34/3/279">decrease employee satisfaction</a>, and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/currency-tag/the-open-office-trap">hurt productivity</a>. The response so far seems to have been to double down and make it, if anything, worse: cubicles are now decidedly un-cool so no-wall open offices are all the rage, and Facebook brags that its new building will be <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2012/08/25/facebook-unveils-new-campus-will-workers-be-sick-stressed-and-dissatisfied/">the largest open floor plan in the world</a>, consisting of a single, <em>ten acre</em> open room.</p>
<p>The result is that today Stack Exchange is decidedly lonely if not quite alone in offering private offices to our developers (at least the half who work in the office; the other half <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/02/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/">work remotely</a>). Suddenly we’re the ones who look a bit old-fashioned: isn’t that the old-school Microsoft approach? Doesn’t it make us less creative? How can we stay fast and agile if people keep disappearing into offices <em>to do work</em>?</p>
<p>We’re pretty sure it doesn’t do any of these things, and in fact we believe it has a lot to do with how we think about work and our developers.</p>
<h1 style="margin: 2em 0 1em;">Find your own rhythm</h1>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/4/joel-spolsky">Joel</a>’s management philosophy is deceptively simple: hire smart people who get things done, and <a href="http://avc.com/2012/02/the-management-team-guest-post-from-joel-spolsky/">get the hell out of their way</a>. The role of management is to give the people who actually do the work &#8212; the developers, designers, sysadmins, etc. &#8212; all the tools they need to get their jobs done, and then trust them to do the job!</p>
<p>This means we give you the space and expect you to find your own rhythm of work. With a private office, you’re in control of your space and attention: you can choose when to close the door and avoid interruptions, and when to go play <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pnGux.jpg">ping-pong</a>, talk with coworkers or work out of the <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nPoto.jpg">coffee bar</a>. In an open office you’re at the mercy of the people around you: if they’re talking, the best you can do is crank up your headphones and hope to drown them out, and if they’re playing foosball then good luck.</p>
<p>Everybody has their own rhythm. People come in at different times, take breaks at different times, need to socialize at different times, and have their most productive hours at different times. Management’s job is to accommodate that and create a space where all those conflicting needs don’t congeal into a persistent hum of distraction &#8212; <em>not</em> to enforce some top-down ideal of openness and creativity. Private offices put the people who do the actual work <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000057.html">in control</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%"><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yLpKY.jpg"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OGdGk.png"/></a><br />
<em>Motorized standing/sitting desks come standard, including for remote employees.</em></p>
<h1 style="margin: 2em 0 1em;">Keep the nexus of activity <em>online</em></h1>
<p>We are an online company: we’ve been remote from day one and still to this day over half of the team (aside from sales) works from home. The only way to make that work is to keep the nexus of activity online: in chat rooms, Google Hangouts, Trello boards, etc. This keeps everyone on equal footing, whether you’re in the office or working from home. Want to know what’s going on? Just check Trello and chat. Don’t go hang out around the watercooler.</p>
<p>This creates a magnificent culture of non-distraction. Whenever we get a new hire in the office, I make it a point to sit down with them in their first week and explain that they <em>should not go to someone’s office when they have a question</em>. Instead, ping them in chat and then jump on a hangout. The result is exactly the sort of culture that open offices are supposed to promote but better:</p>
<ul>
<li>If someone else sees the message, they can chime in with the answer</li>
<li>If someone else is interested in the discussion, they can jump onto the hangout</li>
<li>And, crucially, if someone is working heads-down and doesn’t want to be distracted, <em>all they have to do is close the chat window</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This really is the best of both worlds, and one of the reasons that I’m a big advocate of <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/02/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/">remote work culture</a> even if nobody works remote. And a big part of what makes it possible if you’re working out of an office is having a door you can close so you’re not distracting your coworkers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%"><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/joQex.jpg"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7WPyJ.jpg"/></a><br />
<em>Glass walls let in tons of natural light. It&#8217;s not as creepy as you think.</em></p>
<h1 style="margin: 2em 0 1em;">Schedule time for cross-pollination</h1>
<p>The result is that we get a lot of work done and individuals are fantastically productive. The only thing missing is to make sure that we’re facilitating those cross-team connections that open offices pretend to get you for free. We solve that in a few simple ways: daily lunch together in the office, weekly “Beer Bashes”, and an annual company meetup.</p>
<p>Joel has written a lot about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2011/04/28.html">the benefits of eating lunch together</a> and we’re still big believers in it. Some people get a little weirded out by this so I’ll clarify: lunch together is not required, but anyone who skipped it completely would be missing out on some great food. At Stack Exchange HQ in New York we’re lucky enough to have a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/stack-exchange-kitchen-tour-2014-2">full kitchen</a> and our own <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chefs-at-stack-exchange-2014-2">professional chefs</a> and the results are pretty amazing. Eating lunch together every day is a great way to connect with coworkers you wouldn’t otherwise have talked to, though it doesn&#8217;t quite tie in the remote employees which is what makes the other approaches so important.</p>
<p>Friday “Beer Bashes” have long been another in-office tradition: grab a tasty beverage (alcoholic or not, nobody really cares) and hang out with some of your esteemed colleagues on Friday afternoon before taking off for the weekend. Recently we’ve been experimenting with Remote Beer Bashes via Google Hangouts, with some <a href="https://twitter.com/df07/status/546065652667404288">pretty fantastic results</a>. Now even the remote people can join in and have some fun, even if it’s <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp#q=5pm+eastern+time+in+slovenia">closer to midnight</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp#q=5pm+est+is+what+time+in+philippines">freakishly early</a> in their time zones.</p>
<p>Finally we have an <a href="https://twitter.com/spolsky/status/524596357596979200">annual engineering + community team meetup</a>. We could write a whole post on this, but one of the points we make every year is that the primary goal of the meetup is to meet people and hang out &#8212; any work done is merely a side benefit. This last year we had a pretty great mix of <a href="https://twitter.com/balpha/status/534390400879198209">presentations</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/aalear/status/524681117778341890">meetings</a>, and a strange obsession with <a href="https://twitter.com/WayOverDunne/status/524742986643419136">hangman</a> (oh, and an impromptu <a href="https://twitter.com/sklivvz/status/525058755356946432">war room</a> when we were hit with a novel DDoS attack). The whole thing was a huge success (even the war room) and really got a lot of different teams talking to each other and solving problems together.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%"><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/dlW0T.jpg"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/R4OVZ.jpg"/></a><br />
<em>Lunch served every day at Stack Exchange.</em></p>
<h1 style="margin: 2em 0 1em;">That’s how we work</h1>
<p>Now, of course, the caveat: this is what works for us, and we understand it’s not for everyone. Maybe some places really are more creative because they have open plans. We don’t actually even give <em>everyone</em> private offices: some people are doubled up in offices, and the sales and marketing teams sit in larger open spaces because they feel that&#8217;s an important part of how they work. But it’s continually astonishing to me that more companies aren’t talking about private offices for developers, and that open plans have become the expected norm in the industry. At the very least we should be considering all the benefits that private offices provide.</p>
<p>Oh, and did I mention <a href="http://stackexchange.com/work-here">we’re hiring</a>? If this sounds like the kind of place you’d like to work &#8212; whether out of the office or from home &#8212; <a href="http://stackexchange.com/work-here">we’re hiring for a lot of positions in 2015</a> across all three offices and remote.</p>
<p>In closing, I’ll leave you with a few choice pictures of our office. If you&#8217;d like to explore more, check out the <a href="http://s.tk/NYCTour">Google street view tour of the NYC office</a>. We also have sales offices in <a href="https://twitter.com/spolsky/status/488746851764428801/photo/1">Denver</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/stackexchange.london">London</a> which you can check out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We – which is to say, you, the Stack Exchange community – had another great year in 2014.</p>
<p>We cracked <b>Quantcast’s top 50 networks in the US</b>. We did this without posting celebrity gossip, top 10 lists, or cat pictures. We did it by creating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpGA2fmAHvM">artifacts</a>: useful, canonical bits of information, edited, refined, and curated by our community.</p>
<p>By donating your knowledge to the largest community of developers in the world, you’ve been able to create a slice of the Internet that is indeed a better place. Amidst the noise, clutter, and chaos of the web, you’ve built one of the largest, most trusted knowledge repositories ever created.</p>
<p>How many times did people looking for help find your solutions last year? If you were to take the number of visitors to Stack Exchange sites in 2014, it would be larger than the populations of the United States, Russia and Brazil combined.</p>
<p>(Accommodating this many visitors would not be possible without our <a href="https://stackexchange.com/performance">remarkably lean</a> infrastructure, which served <b>6.4 billion pageviews </b>last year alone.)</p>
<h2>By the Numbers</h2>
<p>Let’s focus on how much you did in 2014 to share your knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>3.1 million new questions asked</li>
<li>4.5 million answers submitted</li>
<li>2.7 million edits, which made those posts even more helpful</li>
<li>17 million comments</li>
<li>3.6 million reviews</li>
<li>21 million upvotes; 3.2 million downvotes; 1.8 million accepted answers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Community Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>In 2014, we launched 20 new beta sites that you proposed through <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq">Area 51</a>, bringing us to a total of <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">133 communities</a> spanning topics as diverse as Economics, Startups, and Buddhism.</li>
<li>5 communities graduated from beta and were fully launched with snazzy new designs: <a href="http://money.stackexchange.com/">Personal Finance and Money</a>, <a href="http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/">Graphic Design</a>, <a href="http://academia.stackexchange.com/">Academia</a>, <a href="http://workplace.stackexchange.com/">The Workplace</a>, and <a href="http://salesforce.stackexchange.com/">Salesforce</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We released native mobile apps for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stack-exchange/id871299723?mt=8">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stackexchange.marvin&amp;hl=en">Android</a>, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stack-exchange/id871299723?mt=8">iPad</a>, (with an Android Tablet version in the works). Just a year in, hundreds of thousands of you have installed them, and you’ve posted more than 15K posts from <del>the bathroom</del> mobile apps.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We launched <a href="https://pt.stackoverflow.com/">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://ja.stackoverflow.com/">Japanese</a> Stack Overflows, our first <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/02/cant-we-all-be-reasonable-and-speak-english/">non-English SOs</a>.  Portuguese is now officially our second fastest-growing community ever after hitting 10,000 questions in only 9 months.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow Careers</a> added 3,700 new company pages and 29,000 job listings. Finding a better job should be as easy for developers as finding answers on Stack Overflow.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Content Superlatives</h2>
<p>Numbers are fine, but answers are better. Let’s look at some of your top posts from 2014.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most viewed post:
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22342854/what-is-the-optimal-algorithm-for-the-game-2048">What is the optimal algorithm for the game, 2048?</a></b> (Stack Overflow, 679k views)</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While testing hats before the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/12/winter-bash-2014/">start of Winter Bash 2014</a>, a snowflake notification told me I&#8217;d earned the <strong>Treasure Hunter</strong> hat. After adjusting pirate paraphernalia to fit my head, I tried to remember what triggers this particular hat. As it happens, I&#8217;d just received a <a href="http://cooking.stackexchange.com/help/badges/28/famous-question?userid=6292">gold badge on Cooking</a> that I would&#8217;ve totally ignored if not for the associated hat. Suddenly I understood why this time of year resonates with our most accomplished users. Earning cosmetic items, as silly as they are, temporarily reminds us of what it was like to begin participating on Stack Exchange months or years ago. Plus, hats look really cool.</p>
<p>This year <strong>84,439 users</strong> earned a total of <strong>244,865 hats</strong>, which is slightly up from <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/01/winter-bash-2013-wrap-up/">last year</a>.</p>
<h2>Secrets revealed</h2>
<p><a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/40980/michaelt"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GHAlP.png?s=128" alt="" title="Chameleon" /></a></p>
<p>The most common hat (awarded 70,361 times to 39,499 distinct users) turned out to be the secret <strong>Chameleon</strong>. On Meta Stack Exchange folks <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/245397/1438">correctly noted</a> that it was triggered by editing certain fields in your profile. Our intention was that it would be triggered by <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/36?m=19067572#19067572">changes in a user&#8217;s avatar</a>. However, due to an <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/242558/profile-image-incorrectly-marked-as-changed-when-editing-other-profile-informati">otherwise low-priority bug</a>, the hat seemingly was awarded randomly after profile edits. So the theme of this hat is less camouflage and more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ch1277quZo">Mixed Up Chameleon</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/users/238586/the-guy-with-the-elf-hat"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/q5p2u.png?s=128" alt="" title="Fascinating" /></a> <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/users/78317/dustin"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qbhfy.png?s=128" alt="" title="Fascinating, Ma'am" /></a></p>
<p>Two more secret hats, <strong>Fascinating</strong> (34,026 times to 25,017 users) and <strong>Fascinating, Ma&#8217;am</strong> (12,342 times to 10,526 users) were earned by voting on posts that were already quite well received. (The first was for upvoting an accepted answer with a score of 5 or more and the second was for voting up a question with 10,000+ views and a score of at least 25.) These are, of course, <a href="http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/54861/is-spocks-use-of-fascinating-unique">Star Trek references</a> which brings the total to three. That compares to one Star <em>Wars</em> reference last year, for those keeping score.</p>
<p><a href="http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/2857/yisela"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/O9zjM.png?s=128" alt="" title="Warm Welcome" /></a></p>
<p>We awarded <strong>Warm Welcome</strong> (14,430 times to 9,597 users) to people who upvoted another user&#8217;s first post. It was gratifying to see so many of these hats awarded. Upvoting quality posts sets up a <a href="http://www.wired.com/2011/06/ff_feedbackloop/all/">positive feedback loop</a> encouraging a new user to post again. Each time I was awarded this hat, I felt good knowing that I&#8217;d done just a little bit to improve the overall quality of content on the site.</p>
<p><a href="http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/users/99/thelper"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/huNhD.png?s=128" alt="" title="Hair Boat" /></a></p>
<p>Last year, <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/463168/abby-hairboat">abby hairboat</a> did such a great job of wrangling hats we descided to <strike>prank her</strike> <em>honor her</em> with a hat awarded to those responding to one of her posts or comments. Hence, the <strong>HairBoat</strong> (awarded 699 times to 569 distinct users). She was so pleased that she promised to send me a gift: a box of live spiders. What a kidder! (In unrelated news, my oldest child will now earn a little extra allowance in exchange for his new title: Family Postal Inspector.)</p>
<p><a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/users/25301/kyle-kanos"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XU6yU.png?s=128" alt="" title="Time Lord" /></a></p>
<p>The last four secret hats were harder to earn than the most common four by more than an order of magnitude. <strong>Time Lord</strong> (404 times to 378 distinct users) was given for people who edited at least 5 questions more than a year old. Plenty of people edit older posts once in a while, but not many update that many out-of-date posts in a short period of time. One of my goals for designing hat triggers was to test potential permanent badge ideas. This trigger (which we also explored with the &#8220;A Link to the Past&#8221; hat last year) is something I hope to evaluate as a badge idea in the coming year.</p>
<p><a href="http://cs.stackexchange.com/users/39/gilles"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wqOkV.png?s=128" alt="" title="Waffles" /></a></p>
<p>I was somewhat surprised with how few people earned <strong>Waffles</strong> (365 times to 331 users) for downvoting a question, editing it, and upvoting it in that order. Looking at the data, it turns out that only about 2% of people who edit a question and later upvote it had downvoted it first. During Winter Bash 2014, the ratio increased to about 10%. Likely some of the increase in pre-downvoting came from dedicated breakfast hat hunters. When you think about it, downvoting a post you are about to edit amounts to wasted effort. Either fix a post until it&#8217;s better or downvote and move on. In sum, a fun concept for a hat (especially if you like waffles), but not a good badge idea.</p>
<p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/users/254929/airthomas"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ucDjK.png?s=128" alt="" title="Eureka!" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, we awarded 15 detectives with the <strong>Eureka!</strong> light bulb for correctly and independently guessing the trigger conditions for secret hats. We didn&#8217;t award Eurekas for guessing Eureka! itself this year since it was largely unchanged from last year.</p>
<h2>Non-secret hats</h2>
<p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/users/259214/nicael"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/FedG3.png?s=128" alt="" title="Saint Lucia" /></a> <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/users/58761/medica"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uiiTA.png?s=128" alt="" title="Kofia" /></a> <a href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/23788/mats-mug"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/PNXnB.png?s=128" alt="" title="Bill Lumbergh" /></a> <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/81495/metafight"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xxOK1.png?s=128" alt="" title="Resolution" /></a> <a href="http://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/3936/private-pansy"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oV71H.png?s=128" alt="" title="Mistletoe" /></a></p>
<p>The most common <em>non-secret</em> hat was <strong>Saint Lucia</strong> (25,444 times to 19,390 users). It was also the first awarded (December 14 at 1200 UTC). Yes, that&#8217;s <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/245255/why-is-the-hat-called-st-lucia">a day late</a>. Other time-based hats were: <strong>Solstice</strong> (7,581 times to 6,858 users), <strong>Kofia</strong> (4,152 times to 4,019 users), <strong>Gelt</strong> (813 times to 757 users), <strong>Bill Lumbergh</strong> (325 times to 318 users), <strong>Resolution</strong> (244 times to 222 users), <strong>Stockings Hung by the Fire</strong> (223 times to 196 users), and <strong>Mistletoe</strong> (207 times to 154 users). Due to timezones, <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/245122/why-didnt-or-did-i-or-some-other-user-get-a-hat-although-the-requirements-wer">we were pretty generous</a> with the timing. But not Mistletoe, which required chatting within a ten minute period around January 1, 2015 0000 UTC. Thankfully our chat servers handled the load just fine.</p>
<p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/246252/on-the-road-hat-is-americentric"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/I8hFl.png?s=128" alt="" title="On the Road" /></a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2292812/m-z"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/zOYCi.png" alt="" title="Got a Tablet for Christmas" /></a></p>
<p>The mobile app must have been <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/category/mobile/">on our mind recently</a> since there are a number of hats that required it: <strong>Bugdroid</strong> (7,115 times to 4,776 users), <strong>Not a cherry</strong> (3,829 times to 2,403 users), <strong>On The Road</strong> (511 times to 451 users), and <strong>Got a Tablet for Christmas</strong> (231 times). I personally got an iPhone 6 for Christmas and used the iOS app to earn &#8220;Not a cherry&#8221;. Verdict: my fingers are still too big for phone-sized keyboards. Maybe I should get a tablet.</p>
<p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/users/209031/kylemit"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qcibM2k.png?s=128" alt="" /></a> <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/users/179335/carrie-kendall"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sD6deSZ.png?s=128" alt="" /></a> <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/users/179335/carrie-kendall"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xmYkOLT.png?s=128" alt="" title="Imitation Crab" /></a> <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/users/179335/carrie-kendall"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vBZS55b.png?s=128" alt="" /></a> <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/users/179335/carrie-kendall"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Lw8Osza.png?s=128" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Right in the middle of Winter Bash, <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/245795/1438">balpha allowed hats to be rotated 360°</a>. Lot&#8217;s of folks took advantage of this to concoct brand new hats such as the <strong>Praying Mantis</strong>, <strong>Soccer Necklace</strong>, <strong>Crab Face Googly Eyes</strong>, <strong>Next Generation Earpiece</strong>, and, of course, the <strong>Mulletbeard™</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/3155639/alexander-omara"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/sBt3o.png?s=128&amp;g=1" alt="" title="Red Baron" /></a></p>
<p>The <em>most difficult</em> hat was the <strong>Red Baron</strong> earned by just 26 users. It required posting an answer that was so good it changed they way people looked at the question. A great example of how this works is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/27507191/1438">this answer</a>, which was submitted while the question was at -7. After the answer (and a strategic edit to the question), the question got 10 straight upvotes to bring the score to +3 at the time of writing. Without the hat, this amazing accomplishment would have gone unrecognized. Especially pleasing for us: the idea for this hat came from a <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/277781/1438">user suggestion</a> to replace the existing Reversal badge. When it comes to amazing, talented and dedicated users, Stack Exchange&#8217;s cup overflows.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been asked to share <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/245680/collect-hat-stats-please">statistics about hats</a> this year, which we are happy to do. In the weeks to come, I will be reporting things we learned from Winter Bash over on <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/winterbash-2014">Meta Stack Exchange</a>. In the meantime, enjoy a few more of my favorite hat-wearing avatars:</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/17034/hans-passant"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/JvOWd.png?s=128" alt="" title="Major Award" /></a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1221571/eran"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3oZAw.png?s=128" alt="" title="Treasure Hunter" /></a> <a href="http://askubuntu.com/users/136381/rpi-awesomeness"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/EUz6d.png?s=128" alt="" title="Selfie" /></a> <a href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/61256/richard"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ySu8F.png?s=128" alt="" title="Fear and Loathing" /></a>  <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/users/150214/fredley"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/T37yA.png?s=128" alt="" title="Business in the front, Party in the back" /></a></p>
<p>As last year, the hats were illustrated by <a href="http://www.eliasstein.com/">Elias Stein</a>. I hope you enjoyed his work as much as we did. Thanks Elias!</p>
<h2>Announcing the winners</h2>
<p><strong>Everyone who participated is a winner!</strong> Okay, that&#8217;s not what you are here for. Four individuals top the <a href="http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com/leaderboard/network">network-wide leaderboard</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/EE1FO.png" alt="Network-wide leaderboard" class="aligncenter"/></p>
<p>Please join me in congratulating the users who earned <strong>all 38 hats</strong> across the network:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://anime.stackexchange.com/users/24/logan-m">Logan M</a> (32 hats on <a href="http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com/leaderboard/anime.stackexchange.com">Anime &amp; Manga</a> and last year&#8217;s winner)</li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/100297/martijn-pieters">Martijn Pieters</a> (35 hats on <a href="http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com/leaderboard/stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>) </li>
<li><a href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/31503/rolfl">rolfl</a> (34 hats on <a href="http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com/leaderboard/codereview.stackexchange.com">Code Review</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/users/98602/mike-miller">Mike Miller</a> (36 hats on <a href="http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com/leaderboard/math.stackexchange.com">Mathematics</a>)*</li>
</ul>
<p>And with that, we must say a fond farewell to the hats of 2014. If you have any feedback on this year&#8217;s event, please <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/246533/winter-bash-closing-remarks-ideas-for-next-year">weigh in on Meta Stack Exchange</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>&#42; The leaderboard counts hats earned across the network. While all four earned the maximum network-wide, the tiebreaker goes to the person who scored the most hats on their home site. Mike Miller&#8217;s <a href="http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com/leaderboard/math.stackexchange.com">36 hats on Mathematics</a> was the maximum he could earn. The two he missed on Math were HairBoat, since <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/users/14167/abby-hairboat">Abby hadn&#8217;t posted on his site</a> and Kofia, which is awarded to brand-new posters only.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are few things that make me more proud to be part of the Stack Exchange community than the outpouring of good will that comes during our &#8220;Giving Back&#8221; program. Each year we set this time aside to remember the organizations and people who need our help by offering to make a <strong>$100 donation to charity on behalf of <em>each</em> community moderator</strong>. It&#8217;s just a small gesture of thanks to our moderators from each community whose hard work makes this all possible.</p>
<p>In our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/?s=stack+gives+back">sixth year of </a><em><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/?s=stack+gives+back">Giving Back</a>,</em> I started to wonder if asking Moderators to select their charities year after year might become somewhat routine and unremarkable.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s been quite the opposite.</p>
<p>As December rolls around, the buzz and anticipation for this event gets <strong><em>stronger</em></strong> with each passing year — <em>&#8220;When do we get to pick our charities?&#8221;</em> — and when the selections finally go out, the passion and enthusiasm of folks rushing in to help is nothing short of remarkable.</p>
<p>So on behalf of the <strong>132 communities and the 433 Moderators of Stack Exchange,</strong> we were able to make the following donations to charity this year:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15049" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/SE-Gives-Back-2014-results.png" alt="SE Gives Back 2014 results" width="657" height="389" /></p>
<p>And from our engineering team, let&#8217;s not forget the tools and organizations that make what we do possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Git and the Software Freedom Conservancy — $1,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>HAProxy — $1,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>jQuery Foundation — $1,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>OpenBSD — $1,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-15056 size-full" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/lonely-red-ball.png" alt="lonely red ball" width="125" height="315" /></p>
<p>Charities embody some of the best qualities in all of us. Whether you&#8217;re fighting for a cause that is important to you, or helping someone whose life may be falling apart, there&#8217;s an almost indescribable bond that forms when neighbor embraces neighbor to overcome whatever difficulties you face.</p>
<p>We may have not had our own <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/11/se-podcast-36-we-got-hit-by-a-hurricane/">Hurricane Sandy event</a> this year, but when you&#8217;re <em>giving back</em> to help others, you can&#8217;t help but reflect back on those times when someone reached out to <em>you,</em> and you start to wonder if perhaps you’ve sparked that same feeling of hope and fellowship in someone else today… if even just a little.</p>
<p>I would like to end this year with glasses held high — to thank all of you, the community of Stack Exchange, for helping us make all of this possible. It&#8217;s times like these that I will reflect back on and cherish always.</p>
<p>Cheers!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><small>Hi English-language readers! This blog post is not for you; perhaps you&#8217;d like <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/12/winter-bash-2014/">a hat</a> instead? No? Well, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/02/cant-we-all-be-reasonable-and-speak-english/">when last we spoke of creating non-English versions of Stack Overflow</a>, some of you were certain we should&#8217;ve gone the easy route and just leveraged a machine translation service instead of creating real sites for real people to use. I humbly invite you to read the rest of this post using the mechanical babelfish of your choice, and see if you think such tools can be relied on for important work&#8230;</small></em></p>
<p>2008年にStack Overflowが設立された目的は、プログラミングに関する質<wbr />問の全ての回答をまとめあげ、それらを提供する場を作る事でした<wbr />。Stack Overflowの誕生以前は、プログラマー自身が自身の貴重な<wbr />時間を使い、複数のブログ、掲示板やニュースグループで回答を検<wbr />索した上で、その回答が有効か否かを自分自身でチェックするしか<wbr />ありませんでした。</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quantcast.com/stackoverflow.com">現在、Stack Overflowは700万個以上の質問をまとめている事で、毎<wbr />月4,400万人のプログラマーをサポートしています。</a>そしてそ<wbr />のうち60万人以上もの人が日本からアクセスしています。<wbr />Stack Overflowは英語のサイトにも関わらず、日本のプラグラマ<wbr />ーのプログラミング問題を解決する為の必要なツールになってきま<wbr />した。</p>
<h2><a href="http://ja.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow日本語版へようこそ</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://ja.stackoverflow.com/"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mLLK5.png"></a></p>
<p><p><a href="http://utashiro.hatenablog.com/entry/20090617/1245201611">日本には100万人以上のプログラマーがいます。</a></p>
<p>Stack Overflow日本語版の誕生により今後は、<wbr />英語と格闘しながらプログラミング問題を解決する必要が無くなり<wbr />ます。</p>
</p>
<p>2014年12月2日にStack Overflow日本語版のプライベートベータを開始し、<wbr />1週間で1000人以上のユーザーと100個以上の質問が集まり<wbr />ました。そして今、<wbr />日本の全てのプログラマーに開放する運びとなりました。<wbr />Stack Overflow英語版と同じ様に皆様と一緒に日本語でのリソー<wbr />スを作成しましょう。</p>
<h2>日本のプログラマーを<wbr />応援しましょう</h2>
<p>これからは日本語でのプログラミングに関する質問や回答の投稿が<wbr />可能となります。<wbr />今日から投稿して頂く質問は将来の日本人プログラマーのサポート<wbr />となります。<wbr />日本のプログラミング能力を集結し皆様の知識のレベルアップを図<wbr />れるチャンスです！</p>
<h2>Stack Overflowは皆様のサイトです</h2>
<p>Stack Overflowはコミュニティのものです。<wbr />参加者は投票する事で最も有効な質問や回答を示す事が出来、<wbr />権限において投稿の編集や管理を行う事も出来ます。そして、<wbr />コミュニティ内で当サイトの改善案を自由にメタで討議する事がで<wbr />きます。コミュニティは既に<a href="http://meta.ja.stackoverflow.com/questions/1381/x%E3%81%AE%E4%B8%80%E8%A6%A7%E3%81%8C%E7%9F%A5%E3%82%8A%E3%81%9F%E3%81%84-%E3%81%A8%E3%81%84%E3%81%86%E8%B3%AA%E5%95%8F%E3%81%AE%E5%82%BE%E5%90%91%E3%81%A8%E4%BB%96%E3%82%B5%E3%82%A4%E3%83%88%E3%81%A7%E3%81%AE%E5%AF%BE%E5%BF%9C">リスト質問</a>や<a href="http://meta.ja.stackoverflow.com/questions/257/%E8%B3%AA%E5%95%8F%E3%81%AE%E5%86%85%E5%AE%B9%E3%81%8C%E8%8B%B1%E8%AA%9E%E7%89%88so%E3%81%A8%E9%87%8D%E8%A4%87%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E5%A0%B4%E5%90%88%E3%81%AE%E5%BC%95%E7%94%A8%E3%83%9E%E3%83%8A%E3%83%BC">リンクのみの回答</a>をどう<wbr />するべきか討議を開始しています。</p>
<p>当サイトは日本語のプログラミング問題・回答のベストリソースを<wbr />目指しています。皆様と一緒に作り上げましょう！</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>There is no better antidote, at least for the worst hours and eclipses of the soul, than to conjure up &hellip;<br/ > serious frivolity.&mdash;<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Nl-vaAdJD3MC&#038;pg=PA61&#038;lpg=PA61#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false">Friedrich Nietzsche</a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/urxgC.png" alt="Winter Bash 2014" width="1004" height="323" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-14908" /></a></p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Winter Bash again?</h2>
<p>No, it&#8217;s not a new flavor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Unix shell</a>. Rather, Winter Bash is an <a href="http://stackexchange.com/promos/2/hat-dash">ancient tradition</a> of Stack Exchange. (2011 is ancient according to Internet time.) Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Starting right now, when you complete one of <a href="http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com/">30-odd challenges</a> while logged on a <a href="http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com/leaderboard">participating site</a>, you will be awarded the associated hat. To notify you, an icon will light up on the top bar. In addition, admire your hat collection on the <a href="http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com/">Winter Bash 2014 site</a>. Finally, your profile includes the number of unique <strike>snowflakes</strike> <strong>hats</strong> (<img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VmGTG.png" alt="You have a hat to wear!" width="24" height="14" align="middle" />) you&#8217;ve earned all around the network.</li>
<li>Once you acquire an item, click your avatar to pick a hat that you earned&mdash;not just on the current site, but anywhere. When you are satisfied the hat&#8217;s position, click &#8220;Wear hat&#8221; and it will be visible everywhere your avatar is displayed. Optionally, you may have a different look on each site. Once you are wearing a hat, you&#8217;ll also see an option to go unadorned. (But really, why would you want that?)
<p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/users/1438/jon-ericson"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8FDy0.png" alt="I&#039;m a pirate!" width="969" height="611" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15006" /></a></li>
<li>On January 4, 2015 at 23:59:59 UTC, all hats will be returned to the Stack Exchange vault. The best way to preserve holiday memories is to <a href="http://www.take-a-screenshot.org/">take plenty of pictures</a> before they are gone.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Again with the hats? What happened to &#8220;We hate fun&#8221;?</h2>
<p>In the face of the darkening days of winter, we put aside our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/stack-overflow-where-we-hate-fun/">steely, businesslike frowns</a> to wear <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Cosmetic_items">virtual cosmetic items</a>. It&#8217;s our solemn duty to cut out the nonsense leaving pure, unadulterated knowledge as permanent artifacts helpful to future visitors. And that task is no laughing matter. </p>
<p>Yet, to quote <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/chesterton/heretics.xvi.html">G. K. Chesterton</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>About what other subjects can one make jokes except serious subjects?</p></blockquote>
<p>The truth is, we don&#8217;t really hate fun. Contributing to a volunteer effort should be an enjoyable experience. Heck, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/09/five-years-ago-stack-overflow-launched-then-a-miracle-occurred/">fake internet points</a> are integral to how these sites operate. Winter Bash reminds us that there&#8217;s more to life than nose-to-the-grindstone work and quality content. We don&#8217;t stop having fun when the event ends. We go back to having fun with a larger purpose.</p>
<h2>Is everything going to be the same as last year?</h2>
<p>Management gave us a clear mandate when it came to building new features into Winter Bash:</p>
<blockquote><p>We were not allowed to spend weeks on snow animation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, we could reuse last year&#8217;s start-of-the-art snowfall algorithm for the <a href="http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com/">official Winter Bash 2014 homepage</a>. There you can discover a nearly<a href="#footnote">*</a> complete list of hats and how you can earn them. The activities this year are mostly fresh and (hopefully) all fun. If you could go ahead and answer 5 questions on Saturday, that&#8217;d be great. Mmmkay?</p>
<p>Once again, we are delighted with the work of freelance illustrator, <a href="http://www.eliasstein.com/">Elias Stein</a>. It&#8217;s difficult to express how satisfying it feels to think up a concept (Tam o&#8217; Shanter!) and have it manifest a few days later:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tam_o%27_Shanter_%28cap%29"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/hdKRn.png" alt="Tam o&#039; Shanter" width="174" height="133" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14912" /></a></p>
<p>In the past, some people have had trouble getting hats to fit properly. <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/12/winter-bash-2013-is-here/">Last year</a>, we added the ability to reposition hats, but that did little to satisfy folks with especially large or disembodied heads. So, this year <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/212056/all-i-want-is-a-well-fitted-hat">hats can be resized and twisted to fit your head</a>. (Thanks, <a href="http://balpha.de/about/">balpha</a>!) </p>
<p><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/users/811/shog9"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9lMdh.png" alt="Shog The Hunter" width="435" height="393" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14917" /></a></p>
<p>If you have any questions about the event, try the <a href="http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com/faq">Frequently Asked Questions.</a> If your question isn&#8217;t covered there, please ask it on <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/winterbash-2014">Meta Stack Exchange</a>, our Q&#038;A site about our network of Q&#038;A sites.</p>
<p>Before signing off, I apologize to our <a href="http://meta.pt.stackoverflow.com/questions/2288/o-que-voc%C3%AAs-t%C3%AAm-na-cabe%C3%A7a">Southern Hemisphere friends</a> for the name. I wanted to go with something season-neutral like HAT ATTACK or December Fling, but tradition ruled the day. Just remember: while you are sipping refreshing drinks and enjoying the sunshine, it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuCO7Kq744U">cold</a>,  wet, and dark up here.</p>
<p><strong>Act now and get <a href="http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com/saint-lucia">an exclusive hat only available today</a>!</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #404040;">Welcome to the 61st installment of the Stack Exchange Podcast, brought to you by okra (yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okra">that okra</a>). On our show today are David Fullerton, Jay Hanlon, and Joel Spolsky. It&#8217;s been a <em>long</em> time since we last did a podcast, so let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>First point of business: <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/11/stack-exchange-for-the-ipad-is-here-and-ios-apps-now-support-ios-8/">we have an iPad app</a>! It&#8217;s got a snazzier feed and a fancy live preview in the Compose view. We&#8217;ve been getting more posts from mobile than we expected, because computing via iPad is the way of the future (according to Joel), so lots of features in the iOS app are now better optimized for posting as opposed to reading.</li>
<li>Moving onto far more important business: <a href="http://instagram.com/p/unn5CKNOeC/">Joel&#8217;s dog Taco got 21,000 likes on Instagram</a>.</li>
<li>PSA: Always make sure your insurance will cover it before you travel to Kansas City. (Any Kansas City. We&#8217;re not sure how many there are, or even which one Joel went to on his zombie visit.)</li>
<li>Also, Garmin makes boats.</li>
<li>By the way, we&#8217;re still talking about the iPad app, apparently. We&#8217;re collecting a lot of data about how our mobile apps are being used to help us gear them better toward the people who are actually using them. Our mobile team (led by <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/users/229741/kasra-rahjerdi">Kasra</a>) has been working really hard on making the apps shine (despite Joel&#8217;s efforts to force random features nobody will use onto them). So try it out (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stack-exchange/id871299723?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stackexchange.marvin&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Dblog">Android</a>) and let us know what you think. We love feedback.</li>
<li>Moving on! We revamped our <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice">Be Nice policy</a> after <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/240839/165581">hashing it out with the community on meta</a>. (We didn&#8217;t handle the feedback part super well. Lessons were learned!) This discussion of it is about as long as the original draft was, so get comfortable.
<ul>
<li>A secondary point of interest: should comments stick around forever, or disappear after 21 days? I bet you can guess Joel&#8217;s opinion. (This question is sheerly hypothetical. Nobody&#8217;s actually proposing this now.)</li>
<li>A tertiary point of business: the numbering of the Ten Commandments <a href="http://christianity.stackexchange.com/a/1136/639">really is disputed</a> &#8211; Joel&#8217;s not making this part up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Okay that&#8217;s great. Next! Joel tries to bring up diversity (spoiler alert: we&#8217;re pro-diversity), but we decide to devote more of a podcast to it later.</li>
<li>Say, David, what is a Stack Snippet? We&#8217;re glad you asked! <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/09/introducing-runnable-javascript-css-and-html-code-snippets/">It&#8217;s essentially a loving knockoff of JSFiddle</a>. They help us ensure that our content stays up-to-date and relevant, and they reduce mental friction.</li>
<li>This is cool: we open-sourced our monitoring system. It&#8217;s called &#8220;<a href="http://bosun.org/">Bosun</a>&#8221; (or &#8220;Boatswain&#8221;, or &#8220;bo&#8217;s&#8217;n&#8221;, or &#8220;the first word of <em>The Tempest</em>&#8220;, but we think it&#8217;s easiest to stick with Bosun). Listen about it in this podcast, read about it on <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/">the blog</a> or <a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/2014/11/10/announcing-bosun/">the Server Fault blog</a>, or <a href="http://bosun.org/gettingstarted.html">just get started</a>. It&#8217;s in alpha, but you can check it out. (Major credit to Matt Jibson and Kyle Brandt for their great work on this project.)</li>
<li>We have a new Q&amp;A site about <a href="http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/">Worldbuilding</a>, and it&#8217;s doing really well &#8211; despite the Community Team&#8217;s misgivings about launching it. We&#8217;ve shifted toward letting most Area 51 proposals test their legs in private beta &#8211; as long as they don&#8217;t embarrass us or duplicate or overlap significantly with other sites. That&#8217;s why we decided to launch Worldbuilding even though we didn&#8217;t understand it &#8211; and luckily, they proved us wrong.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/q/3453/44">Could a government control its people using frequencies?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/q/3976/44">Does the sun being blocked affect electricity?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/q/3722/44">How would an aquatic race develop computers?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/q/3903/44">Is Superman a peeping Tom? or Would x-ray vision be biologically reasonable?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/q/3871/44">How close to interstellar space travel could humans get in the near future?</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Worldbuilding is in public beta. So is:
<ul>

		<itunes:summary>Welcome to the 61st installment of the Stack Exchange Podcast, brought to you by okra (yes, that okra). On our show today are David Fullerton, Jay Hanlon, and Joel Spolsky. It&#8217;s been a long time since we last did a podcast, so let&#8217;s get started.

First point of business: we have an iPad app! It&#8217;s got a snazzier feed and a fancy live preview in the Compose view. We&#8217;ve been getting more posts from mobile than we expected, because computing via iPad is the way of the future (according to Joel), so lots of features in the iOS app are now better optimized for posting as opposed to reading.
Moving onto far more important business: Joel&#8217;s dog Taco got 21,000 likes on Instagram.
PSA: Always make sure your insurance will cover it before you travel to Kansas City. (Any Kansas City. We&#8217;re not sure how many there are, or even which one Joel went to on his zombie visit.)
Also, Garmin makes boats.
By the way, we&#8217;re still talking about the iPad app, apparently. We&#8217;re collecting a lot of data about how our mobile apps are being used to help us gear them better toward the people who are actually using them. Our mobile team (led by Kasra) has been working really hard on making the apps shine (despite Joel&#8217;s efforts to force random features nobody will use onto them). So try it out (iOS, Android) and let us know what you think. We love feedback.
Moving on! We revamped our Be Nice policy after hashing it out with the community on meta. (We didn&#8217;t handle the feedback part super well. Lessons were learned!) This discussion of it is about as long as the original draft was, so get comfortable.

A secondary point of interest: should comments stick around forever, or disappear after 21 days? I bet you can guess Joel&#8217;s opinion. (This question is sheerly hypothetical. Nobody&#8217;s actually proposing this now.)
A tertiary point of business: the numbering of the Ten Commandments really is disputed &#8211; Joel&#8217;s not making this part up.


Okay that&#8217;s great. Next! Joel tries to bring up diversity (spoiler alert: we&#8217;re pro-diversity), but we decide to devote more of a podcast to it later.
Say, David, what is a Stack Snippet? We&#8217;re glad you asked! It&#8217;s essentially a loving knockoff of JSFiddle. They help us ensure that our content stays up-to-date and relevant, and they reduce mental friction.
This is cool: we open-sourced our monitoring system. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Bosun&#8221; (or &#8220;Boatswain&#8221;, or &#8220;bo&#8217;s&#8217;n&#8221;, or &#8220;the first word of The Tempest&#8220;, but we think it&#8217;s easiest to stick with Bosun). Listen about it in this podcast, read about it on the blog or the Server Fault blog, or just get started. It&#8217;s in alpha, but you can check it out. (Major credit to Matt Jibson and Kyle Brandt for their great work on this project.)
We have a new Q&#38;A site about Worldbuilding, and it&#8217;s doing really well &#8211; despite the Community Team&#8217;s misgivings about launching it. We&#8217;ve shifted toward letting most Area 51 proposals test their legs in private beta &#8211; as long as they don&#8217;t embarrass us or duplicate or overlap significantly with other sites. That&#8217;s why we decided to launch Worldbuilding even though we didn&#8217;t understand it &#8211; and luckily, they proved us wrong.

Could a government control its people using frequencies?
Does the sun being blocked affect electricity?
How would an aquatic race develop computers?
Is Superman a peeping Tom? or Would x-ray vision be biologically reasonable?
How close to interstellar space travel could humans get in the near future?


Worldbuilding is in public beta. So is:

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down?<br />
We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.<br/><br />
- <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jack_Handey">Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</a></p></blockquote>
<p>A big part of scaling up an engineering team is getting serious about monitoring and alerts. A good monitoring system collects data from all of your various systems &#8212; for example, how fast pages are loading, or server CPU usage, or emails being sent &#8212; and alerts you when something isn&#8217;t working correctly. When everything works perfectly you can sleep easy at night knowing that you&#8217;ll get an alert if something isn&#8217;t working correctly.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the theory, anyway. About a year ago we realized that our monitoring system needed some serious upgrading. Instead of proactively alerting us before something broke, it mostly alerted us that something was already down. When we did get an alert it wasn&#8217;t obvious what exactly was breaking or who needed to fix it. If you&#8217;re a developer or sysadmin this email inbox probably looks a bit familiar:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oR3cl.png" alt="alert hell" /></p>
<p>So we set out to fix it. We weren&#8217;t happy with any of the tools available so we decided to build our own. Since we are big fans of giving back to the community, we decided to make it open source as well.</p>
<p>The new system is called <a href="http://bosun.org/">Bosun</a> (because <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/it-stack-overflow-update-naming-is-hard/">naming is hard</a>) and was developed by our own <a href="http://serverfault.com/users/2561/kyle-brandt">Kyle Brandt</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/864236/mjibson">Matt Jibson</a>. It&#8217;s still very much in development but we&#8217;ve been using it internally for a few months and are really happy with the results. We can measure much more intelligently and build complex alerts based on those metrics. Some of the things it makes easy are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Push data into Bosun from anywhere via a simple JSON api, or use <a href="http://bosun.org/scollector/">scollector</a> to collect common metrics from lots of different systems</li>
<li>Test alerts against older data and see when they <i>would</i> have gone off</li>
<li>Reduce email clutter with scope-aware alerts, so when e.g. redis goes down we get one email, not twelve (one for each instance)</li>
<li>Forecast and alert against <i>future</i> data, like when we’re about to run out of disk space</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested, read the full announcement (with a lot more detail) on the <a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/2014/11/10/announcing-bosun/">Server Fault blog</a> or go straight to <a href="http://bosun.org/">bosun.org</a> to check it out. There&#8217;s a link on the <a href="http://bosun.org/gettingstarted.html">Getting Started page</a> to a Docker image that populates itself with some data for you to experiment with. And if you happen to be at LISA this week you can check out <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa14/conference-program/presentation/brandt">Kyle Brandt’s talk</a> on Thursday.</p>
<p>As with any open source project, we&#8217;re looking for a few brave souls to join us. You can grab <a href="https://github.com/bosun-monitor/bosun">the source on GitHub</a> and start submitting issues and pull requests today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stack-exchange/id871299723?mt=8" title="Look! Pretty! Stop reading and start downloading!"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/z831f.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>When we launched our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/05/stack-exchange-for-iphone-is-here/" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/01/stack-exchange-for-android-is-here/" target="_blank">Android</a> apps, we were pretty sure they’d help our most active users in a couple of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Push inbox notifications</strong> are epic &#8211; you can know the minute you get an answer or someone comments on your post.</li>
<li><b>The personalized mobile feed</b> lets you browse all content relevant to you, whether it’s posts from your communities or replies to your posts.</li>
<li><b>Voting, commenting, and minor edits</b> are all things you often want to do when you’re away from your desktop, and an interface built for touch makes them a breeze.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those were a huge success; a ton of our most active users loved them. Here’s what we didn’t expect:</p>
<p><b>A <i>lot</i> of people are <i>posting</i></b><b> from the app.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Over twenty-five <i>thousand </i>posts have been made from the app&#8230;</li>
<li>&#8230;More than 69% of them are answers!</li>
<li>The average quality of the posts is significantly higher than the overall average.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Those on-screen buttons may not have the same satisfying click your <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/366221/differences-between-cherry-mechanical-keyboard-switches" title="If you can't get buckling springs, Blue will do">Cherry MXs</a> do, but despite your freakishly large thumbs, an <i>amazing</i> number of you are helping others from the bus. Or in line at the DMV. Or at other times that you’re&#8230; just not at your computer. (They tell me I can’t make a “or while in the bathroom” joke here. Because of course that would be a <i>joke</i>, right?) That’s not just a reflection of how dedicated our users are to sharing their knowledge; it’s also awesome for my personal job security, so thanks!</p>
<div style="float:right;margin:5px;"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MoQTO.png" alt="" style="width:200px;" /><br /><small><em>(Phil Schiller with actual-size prototypes.)</em></small></div>
<h3>Bigger is Better</h3>
<p>So that’s all great. But we still had a problem. Sure, the iPhone 6+ is big &#8211; but even the new iPhone 6+ probably can’t show you all the upvotes you’ve earned today from all the knowledge you’ve dropped lately.</p>
<p>So, what are you supposed to do? Scroll? Like an animal?!?</p>
<p>We thought not. So, we’re ecstatic to announce Stack Exchange for iPad, built from the ground up for the ideal tablet experience.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stack-exchange/id871299723?mt=8"><b>Go download it now!</b></a> What if we raised the price to $0.99 next week? Think about how long you&#8217;d agonize over paying nearly a dollar for this wonderful app. We really don’t want that stress for you, so go get it now. (Okay, we’re probably not going to charge for it. But why risk it? Isn’t life stressful enough?)</p>
<h3>The Feed: Bigger than Ever</h3>
<p>Thanks to the bigger screen real estate, we were able to let the feed display way more of your recent notifications, achievements, and recommended questions. If you haven&#8217;t downloaded it yet, there&#8217;s a screenshot at the top of this post &#8211; just <i>look at all that information!</i></p>
<p><br clear="both">There’s also a dedicated, swipe-browsable hot questions section at the top. Did you ever wish you could swipe new things onto your screen, without the sense of guilt that comes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinder_(application)" target="_blank">swiping a human out of your life based entirely on their looks</a>? Have you ever wanted to know <a href="http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/1406/could-a-technological-society-develop-without-wood" target="_blank">if a society could evolve without wood</a>, or <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/204723/do-submarines-float" target="_blank">if submarines technically “float”</a>? Your day has come.<br />
<img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6bI6J.gif" /><br />
<br clear="both"></p>
<h3>Editor and Preview Just Might be <i>Better</i> than on the Web</h3>
<p>We can’t overstate how happy we’ve been to see people writing actual, great posts on the go. This new update makes that even easier, with touch-optimized Markdown tools in the composer, and a live preview that’s right next to the compose window, so you can see your beautiful formatting as you type (without scrolling!)</p>
<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eJOAI.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is just the start. Given how much you’re posting using the applications, we’re going to be focusing a lot on making the entire process nicer.</p>
<p>When we started out, we thought the iPad standard browser experience was pretty solid, and we decided we weren’t going to build an iPad app unless we thought it actually improved that experience. Between the touch optimized browsing and interface elements, side-by-side composing, and a much more integrated experience going from one site to the next, we’re convinced it does just that &#8211; we’ve been testing it a lot internally for the last few months and I can’t live without it; hopefully you’ll feel the same.</p>
<p>So, if you’ve got an iPad, get to the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stack-exchange/id871299723?mt=8" target="_blank">store and download it now</a>. (No worries, it’s still free. For now&#8230;)  If you’re an iPhone user, the new update also includes lots of quality of life changes for you too (including full iOS 8 support), so upgrade or install it today! </p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stack-exchange/id871299723" target="_blank"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gbyay.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h3>Not an iOS user?</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you’re an Android tablet user, don’t worry, we’re working on things to make you happy too.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re a Windows Phone pioneer, check out <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225624/official-stack-exchange-application-for-windows-phone-os">this meta discussion</a>.</li>
<li>If you’re anxiously waiting for a Symbian or WebOS version, please submit your request via betamax video, ideally delivered by a human being riding on a horse, don’t forget to have another person following to clean up after the horse.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>These apps couldn&#8217;t have happened without our incredible beta testers from the community, and we’re counting on you to tell us how to make it even better! Please post any feature requests you have on <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/tags/feature-request">Meta</a> &#8211; and if you find a bug, <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/tags/bug">please report that too</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><small><sup>1</sup> To be fair, there’s probably a lot of selection bias there &#8211; the app users are likely our most active, experienced users, but the point is this: the posts from the app are <i>good.</i><br />
<sup>2</sup> Technically, it’s iOS 1.2.0, a universal app available now for iPhone and iPad.</small></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/4368/explainer"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4kwcd.png" alt="Explainer - Edited and answered 1 question (both actions within 12 hours, answer score &gt; 0)" /></a><br />

<p><b><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/239898/new-three-tiered-badge-idea-explainer-refiner-illuminator">We rolled out three new badges last week!</a></b></p>
<p>These recognize a pattern that sets Stack Exchange apart from the forums and message boards that came before it: answering <em>and</em> editing questions, the ability to not only write an answer that can be useful beyond the immediate asker but also <em>re-write the question</em> such that it can be found and understood by future readers. Thanks to this capability, brilliant explanations need not languish under titles such as “C++ problem” or “Java doubt” &#8211; having written an answer that ably fixed the problems in the asker’s code, it is possible to also <em>fix the problems in his writing!</em></p>
<p>It’s no surprise then that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users?tab=Editors&amp;filter=all">the top editors</a> tend to include an awful lot of the top <em>answerers</em>. If you’re good at writing, good enough to consistently hammer out insightful answers, you’d be a fool <em>not</em> to make sure the introductions to those answers &#8211; the questions being answered &#8211; were of similar quality. Yet, this seemingly-obvious technique remains unknown to many &#8211; indeed, I’ve heard some express shock at the notion that answerers would be allowed to touch the words of those whose questions they strive to interpret and address.</p>
<p>Well, you are allowed. And now, <em>encouraged!</em></p>
<p>As with previous sets of badges, the bronze level exists to provide a form of “just in time” learning for new users, while the silver and gold levels offer increasingly <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/4370/illuminator">lofty goals</a> to strive for.</p>
<h2 id="recent-changes-to-suggested-edits">Recent changes to suggested edits</h2>
<p>With <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/suggested-edits-and-edit-review/">the introduction of suggested edits</a>, we sought to make the immense power of editing available to anyone reading the site. Instead of going into effect immediately, <em>suggested</em> edits required approval from some number of people who had already earned <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/edit">full editing privileges</a>, thus ensuring some resistance to spammers, vandals and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griefer">griefers</a> as well as a path by which inexperienced editors could be guided by those with more exposure to community norms. However, several serious deficiencies in this system became apparent over the past few years, so we’ve now taken steps to correct them:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/120624/decision-on-rejected-edits-should-be-displayed-as-a-notification-to-the-editor"><b>We’re now notifying editors of past rejections</b></a> when they load the edit form.<br />
<img title="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qbgMw.png" alt="" /><br />
There are some checks in place to avoid hassling folks with <em>occasional</em> rejections, but for a new editor whose edits are being rejected these should help them to improve before they waste <em>too</em> much of their time.</li>
<li><a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/260341/dont-allow-suggested-edits-to-be-finished-while-someone-has-clicked-improve/270498#270498"><b>Reviewers are given a limited period of exclusivity for edits they’re reviewing</b></a>, during which the edit won’t be assigned to anyone else for review. This should greatly reduce the frustration for conscientious reviewers, who might previously find the edit they were reviewing (or improving) already approved or rejected by the time they submitted their review.</li>
<li>Reviewers who wish to perform edits themselves have the option of <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/149722/approve-as-too-minor/238039#238039"><b>either approving and editing on top of the suggestion, or rejecting and replacing it with a different edit</b></a>.<br />
<img title="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nFF8O.png" alt="" /><br />
This replaces both the previous “Improve” option, and the “too minor” rejection reason, allowing edits that make small changes <em>while overlooking large flaws</em> to be quickly discarded, while ensuring that truly <em>helpful</em> edits &#8211; even small ones &#8211; are more consistently approved. Combined with change #2, this gives a great deal more power to reviewers who are comfortable <em>editing</em> &#8211; and who better to review edits than editors?</li>
<li>Finally, <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/238333/what-guidance-should-be-given-when-edits-are-rejected/239950#239950"><b>we’ve revamped the rest of the predefined suggested edit rejection reasons</b></a>, improving their context-sensitivity and focusing more specifically on common mistakes and outright abuse.<br />
<img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/oX9aq.png"></li>
</ol>
<p>Together, these changes should offer better guidance to both editors <em>and</em> reviewers, helping both work together effectively.</p>
<hr />
<p>Big thanks to everyone who chimed in on the meta discussions linked above, as well as those who’ve repeatedly reported these problems over the past few years. Gratitude is also due to the developers who patiently worked to implement these changes, Geoff Dalgas (badges, review changes) and Kevin Montrose (edit rejection feedback). And of course, <em>huge</em> thanks to everyone who uses this tooling in spite of the occasional rough edges.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Stack Overflow and our other code-related sites, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">creating a minimal, complete, and verifiable example</a> is the best way to get an answer to your question. We’ve always loved <a href="http://www.jsfiddle.net">JSFiddle</a> and sites like it because they let both askers and answerers reference runnable, working code that demonstrates their problem or solution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the use of these external sites introduces a few problems:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/114942/when-jsfiddle-and-other-related-sites-are-gone-so-is-the-information">If the link breaks, the post becomes worthless</a>.</li>
<li>If the code isn’t embedded in the page, visitors are <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8231/are-answers-that-just-contain-links-elsewhere-really-good-answers">forced to go elsewhere</a> to get the <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/80978/questions-linking-to-external-web-sites-instead-of-showing-code">full content of the question or answer</a>.</li>
<li>Also, because the code isn’t a part of our post Markdown, changes to it don’t show up in the revision history.</li>
</ol>
<p>The community voiced similar concerns around external sites, which eventually led us to <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/149890/prevent-posts-with-links-to-jsfiddle-and-no-code">block posts that contain links to JSFiddle and similar sites without a corresponding code block</a>. This is an unnecessary burden for both askers and answerers.</p>
<p>So we’ve created our own way to embed runnable JavaScript, CSS, and HTML code blocks right in the body of a post. As of today, we&#8217;re launching “Stack Snippets,” a fully integrated feature available on Stack Overflow and any other code-related Stack Exchange sites.</p>
<h2>How Do Stack Snippets Work?</h2>
<p>With Stack Snippets, a code block:</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="//i.stack.imgur.com/kZPXw.png"><img src="//i.stack.imgur.com/kZPXw.png" alt="Code block" /></a></div>
<p>Can become a <i>runnable</i> code block:</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="//i.stack.imgur.com/YMvu1.png"><img src="//i.stack.imgur.com/YMvu1.png" alt="Runnable code block" /></a></div>
<p>The code will not run until you press the “Run code snippet<b>”</b> button:</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="//i.stack.imgur.com/b9ukx.png"><img src="//i.stack.imgur.com/b9ukx.png" alt="Runnable code block that has been executed" /></a></div>
<h2>How Do I Make A Stack Snippet?</h2>
<p>Stack Snippets work for both questions and answers. In the Markdown editor window, there’s a new button that you can click to launch the Stack Snippets editor.</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="//i.stack.imgur.com/h6BFu.png"><img src="//i.stack.imgur.com/h6BFu.png" alt="The Markdown toolbar with the new Stack Snippet button" /></a></div>
<p>The editor appears and allows you to enter HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or any combination of them):</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="//i.stack.imgur.com/wx8jF.png"><img src="//i.stack.imgur.com/wx8jF.png" alt="The Stack Snippet editor" /></a></div>
<p>Once you’ve got your code working, press &#8220;Insert into Post&#8221; at the bottom and you’re done! You can test your snippet, or load it back into the Snippets editor from right in the Preview screen:</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="//i.stack.imgur.com/KO2TC.png"><img src="//i.stack.imgur.com/KO2TC.png" alt="The run and edit options of Stack Snippets in the editor preview" /></a></div>
<p>When answering a post containing a snippet, you can easily include a modified version of the original in your answer &#8211; just click the &#8220;Copy snippet to answer&#8221; button.</p>
<h2>Under the Hood</h2>
<p>A great feature of Stack Snippets is that they are inserted as <b>regular Markdown code blocks</b>:</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="//i.stack.imgur.com/zXjtQ.png"><img src="//i.stack.imgur.com/zXjtQ.png" alt="The actual Markdown of a Stack Snippet" /></a></div>
<p>This makes them instantly backwards-compatible with our normal revision history and diffs, and also any API clients including our own <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/05/stack-exchange-for-iphone-is-here">mobile</a> <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/01/stack-exchange-for-android-is-here">apps</a>.</p>
<p>The runnable snippets behavior is triggered by a few new HTML comments that are not rendered by Markdown. You can even edit the code right from the Markdown editor and the snippet will still be runnable.</p>
<h2>Are Stack Snippets Safe?</h2>
<p><b>Yes, as much as the web in general is safe.</b> You are not in any more danger than you are when browsing any site with JavaScript enabled. With that said, the snippets <i>are running client code in your browser</i>, and you should always exercise caution when running code contributed by another user.</p>
<p>We isolate snippets from our sites to block access to your private Stack Exchange data:</p>
<ul>
<li>We use <strong>HTML5 sandboxed iframes</strong> in order to prevent many forms of malicious attack.</li>
<li>We <strong>render the Snippets on an external domain</strong> (<a href="http://stacksnippets.net">stacksnippets.net</a>) in order to ensure that the same-origin policy is not in effect and to keep the snippets from accessing your logged-in session or cookies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like all other aspects of our site, Stack Snippets are ultimately <b>governed by the community</b>. Because users can still write code that creates annoying behaviors like infinite loops or pop-ups, we disable snippets on any post that is heavily downvoted (scoring less than -3 on Stack Overflow, -8 on Meta). If you see bad code that you think should be disabled, <b>downvote the post</b>. If you see code that is intended to be harmful (such as an attempt at phishing), you should <strong>flag it for moderator attention</strong>.</p>
<h2>What About Other Languages?</h2>
<p>Our initial release supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because questions on these topics use external code hosting sites the most frequently. These languages also run client-side in the user’s browser, making them self-contained and easy to support. Server-side languages are much more complicated and require significant infrastructure changes in order to properly implement. We don’t have any specific plans at this time to implement other languages, but it’s something we might consider in the future.</p>
<h2>What About Sites Like JSFiddle?</h2>
<p><b>You can still use sites like JSFiddle if you prefer them</b>. JSFiddle and similar sites still have a bunch of features that we have not implemented yet. The normal rules for a link still apply: make sure you <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/84342/answer-that-only-contains-a-link-to-jsfiddle">copy the relevant code</a> into your question or answer so that it can be accessed if the external site is unavailable.</p>
<p>We decided to implement our own version instead of embedding a third-party site for the reasons mentioned earlier:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>There’s no need to copy-paste the code into the post.</b> It’s all embedded in the post automatically, so revision history and diffs just work.</li>
<li><b>There’s no need to visit another site to get your answer. </b>The best experience is one where your question and answer(s) are complete and on the same page.</li>
<li><b>Since we host it, we can guarantee performance and up-time</b>. We have high standards when it comes to performance and up-time, and want to make sure that the ability to run a snippet is always available.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Give Stack Snippets A Try</h2>
<p>We’re excited to see how the community uses Stack Snippets, and looking forward to your feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you find bugs, or you’d like to give specific feedback on Stack Snippets, you can post on <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/ask?tags=stack-snippets">Meta Stack Exchange</a> using the tag <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stack-snippets">stack-snippets</a>.</li>
<li>If you just want to try it out, we’ve <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/239456/stack-snippets-sandbox-try-it-out-here">created a sandbox on Meta Stack Exchange</a>.</li>
<li>If you feel that a particular site should have Stack Snippets, post a feature-request on that site&#8217;s meta &#8211; if there&#8217;s support from the community there, we&#8217;ll enable them.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/62577/bouncing-stacking-boxes">We&#8217;ve already started piloting it on Code Review and are seeing some neat results</a>. Don&#8217;t hesitate to share interesting examples you come across &#8211; <i>or create</i> &#8211; here in the comments.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Stack Exchange continues to expand to serve new audiences, we&#8217;re constantly on the lookout for folks who can take the principles and practices we all hold dear and communicate them effectively to the folks who would otherwise find them strange and difficult. I&#8217;m happy to announce we&#8217;ve found another of these rare specimens in the form of <a href="http://workplace.stackexchange.com/users/7945/jmac" title="Also known by the inscrutable pseudonym &quot;jmac&quot;"><b>Joshua Maciel</b></a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://workplace.stackexchange.com/users/7945/jmac" title="He's smiling because community management is so awesome. The beer has nothing to do with it. Well, mostly nothing. Everything."><img style="float: left; width: 256px; margin-right: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 5px; border: 1px solid black;" alt="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ne1Ja.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Josh joins us remotely from beautiful Kansai Japan, where youthful ignorance brought him for a two-year stay (maximum!) to teach English. Eleven years later he still hasn’t left, having found gainful employment doing international sales for Japanese manufacturers, along with something he refers to as a ‘social life’ in Western Japan.</p>
<p>After living extensively in two cultures, and working in a half-dozen more, Josh decided that humans are really interesting, despite all their peccadilloes. And what better way to study these humans in their natural habitat than by participating on Stack Exchange! </p>
<p>Josh first caught our attention on Meta, gaining the admiration and respect of us all by politely pointing out how <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/211080/improving-demonstrate-a-minimal-understanding-close-reason/215220#215220">incredibly wrong</a> and <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/219922/what-is-the-goal-of-hot-network-questions/220099#comment719219_220099">delusional</a> most of my opinions are. After a few months of respectable participation on Stack Overflow, he joined <a href="http://workplace.stackexchange.com/" title="Dear jmac, my job sucks and my co-workers are all annoying and I may have body odor issues. What should I do?">our site for questions about workplace</a> and career-related issues and proved me wrong once again by helping the good folk there to push that site out of the beta doldrums and into graduation. He then proceeded to get himself <a href="http://workplace.stackexchange.com/election/1">elected as a moderator</a>, where he continued to demonstrate the sort of dedication and tact that has been his hallmark. </p>
<p>Josh can usually be found in his natural habitats: at a baseball game somewhere in the world, sitting with a book in Ubud, or finding a local watering hole to escape the Japanese summer heat. Please join me in toasting to his health as he takes on this new challenge.</p>
<hr style="clear: both;" />
<p>Do <i>you</i> have a unique set of skills that would benefit the growing communities here on Stack Exchange? We&#8217;re <a href="http://stackexchange.com/work-here">always looking for more help</a>, and would love to hear from you &#8211; whether you&#8217;re near our NYC HQ or <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/02/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/">anywhere else in the world.</a> You get to work with <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/company/stack-exchange">enthusiastic folks like Josh</a> and help us guide Stack Exchange as it grows!</p>

<p>Whew. Time to let Uncle David walk us through about a hundred new features that have launched since our last podcast.</p>
<ul>
<li>Curtail Recidivism of Q-Blocked/Suspended Accounts on Deletion. This is exactly what it sounds like (unless it sounds like nonsense). This makes it so that people who are blocked or suspended can no longer delete their accounts and create a new, non-suspended account.</li>

<li>We also redesigned <a href="http://stackexchange.com/work-here">the Hiring page</a>. You should come work with us!</li>
<li>And we redesigned the mobile website, which you can check out by visiting any Stack Exchange site from your mobile device (unless it&#8217;s a BlackBerry).</li>

<li><a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Careers</a> got a new feature, too: <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/explore">City Pages</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#8217;s everything we&#8217;ve done for the last few months, except for the secret stuff David won&#8217;t tell us about.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for our Featured Community. This time around it&#8217;s <a style="color: #0069d6;" href="http://ux.stackexchange.com/"><strong>User Experience</strong></a>!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/31359/should-error-messages-apologize">Should error messages apologize?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/49991/should-yes-delete-it-be-red-or-green">Should &#8220;Yes, delete it&#8221; be red, or green?</a></li>

</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s time to talk about quality again. Jay is hopeful, because we had a great fight about this <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/05/podcast-59-hes-one-of-those-science-ists/">last time</a>. Briefly: the perceived quality on Stack Overflow has been in decline for years. And <em>this</em> time, we&#8217;ve got numbers and things. Our current homepage algorithm was actively highlighting unanswered questions. We <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/stack-overflow-homepage-changes/">did this on purpose</a>, but that was a long time ago. The effect of that system is that unanswer<strong>able</strong> questions stay on the homepage, because the average and good ones get answered almost immediately. So it makes Stack Overflow look like a site full of bad, unanswered questions.</p>
<p>So <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/?tab=recommended">here&#8217;s the new recommended tab</a>. It&#8217;s doing two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not filtering out unanswered stuff.</li>
<li>Weighting toward the tags that you&#8217;re interested in, but now with more randomness.</li>
</ol>
<p>You see a broader distribution of stuff. It&#8217;s not perfect, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a little hidden for now, but we&#8217;ll keep working on it!</p>
<p>The other angle we&#8217;re attacking this from is the low-quality algorithm. Or rather, the quality score algorithm. (The algorithm itself is very high quality.) We did some science and we threw a bunch of data into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowpal_Wabbit">Vowpal Wabbit</a>(not a typo) and built a predictor of question quality, which has given us lots of interesting information to work with. We can use hard blocks and warnings to teach people asking questions things like &#8220;add some code!&#8221; or &#8220;make sure you explain what your code is doing!&#8221;. But we don&#8217;t want to just tell people not to use certain words, because then they&#8217;re only learning not to say &#8220;thanks&#8221;, not how to write a good question. So the low quality algorithm can flag your question to be sent to a review queue before it can show up on the homepage. Probably. (This is all still up for debate.)</p>
<p>This is primarily a Stack Overflow thing, so <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/">Meta Stack Overflow</a> is the best place to discuss it. Have at it!</p>
<p>And finally, we&#8217;ll discuss <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/261505/is-it-true-that-if-someone-reaches-200k-reputation-he-she-gets-a-painting-with-a">the most important meta post of all</a>.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast episode number 60, brought to you by The National Pepperjack Cheese Council. Your hosts today are Joel Spolsky, Jay Hanlon, and David Fullerton (aka Fake Producer Abby).
We&#8217;ll jump right into things with Community Milestones, but we promise to make them quick.

Puzzling is now in public beta, and it&#8217;s about puzzles.
Data Science (DAY-ta, not DAH-ta) is in public beta, and doing better than that topic&#8217;s previous iterations.
Craft CMS, yet another CMS site, is now in public beta as well.
Buddhism is now also in &#8211; surprise! &#8211; public beta.
Last one: Hinduism is in public beta as well.

Whew. Time to let Uncle David walk us through about a hundred new features that have launched since our last podcast.

Curtail Recidivism of Q-Blocked/Suspended Accounts on Deletion. This is exactly what it sounds like (unless it sounds like nonsense). This makes it so that people who are blocked or suspended can no longer delete their accounts and create a new, non-suspended account.
New badges: Curious, Inquisitive, and Socratic. These badges go to folks with a consistent pattern of asking good questions, which we hope will help encourage our users to ask more questions.
We redesigned the Stack Exchange homepage&#8230; again. (The pendulum swings.) Make it your homepage! (Or don&#8217;t.)
We also redesigned the Hiring page. You should come work with us!
And we redesigned the mobile website, which you can check out by visiting any Stack Exchange site from your mobile device (unless it&#8217;s a BlackBerry).
The Community Bulletin got redesigned as well.
Careers got a new feature, too: City Pages.

And that&#8217;s everything we&#8217;ve done for the last few months, except for the secret stuff David won&#8217;t tell us about.
It&#8217;s time for our Featured Community. This time around it&#8217;s User Experience!

Should error messages apologize?
Should &#8220;Yes, delete it&#8221; be red, or green?
How can users be prevented from pouring water into the bean compartment of a coffee machine?

We did some science and we threw a bunch of data into Vowpal Wabbit(not a typo) and built a predictor of question quality, which has given us lots of interesting information to work with. We can use hard blocks and warnings to teach people asking questions things like &#8220;add some code!&#8221; or &#8220;make sure you explain what your code is doing!&#8221;. But we don&#8217;t want to just tell people not to use certain words, because then they&#8217;re only learning not to say &#8220;thanks&#8221;, not how to write a good question. So the low quality algorithm can flag your question to be sent to a review queue before it can show up on the homepage. Probably. (This is all still up for debate.)
This is primarily a Stack Overflow thing, so Meta Stack Overflow is the best place to discuss it. Hav[...]</itunes:summary>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the 59th running of the Stack Exchange podcast, brought to you by Nutella! Your hosts Joel Spolsky, David Fullerton, and Jay Hanlon are joined this week by special guests Josh Heyer (aka Shog9) and Robert Cartaino (aka Robert Cartaino) of the Stack Exchange Community Growth team.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got a busy podcast scheduled, so let&#8217;s get down to business, starting with <b>New Features</b> with Uncle David.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are revamping the user profile, and you can <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/231112/profile-page-makeover-part-2-the-prototype">check it out and give us feedback</a> (and please do!).</li>
<li>We are testing some new Careers ads on Stack Overflow. Hang onto your hats, people. We use the words &#8220;astonishing&#8221; and &#8220;frightening&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">Hawthorne effect</a>&#8220;.</li>
<li>If you have a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/badges?tab=tags&amp;filter=gold">gold tag badge</a>, you can now Insta-Close-As-Dupe. This addresses <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/">the &#8220;Lord of the Flies&#8221; problem</a>.</li>
<li>The iOS app is on Joel&#8217;s phone, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stack-exchange/id871299723?mt=8">it can be on yours, too</a>! If you&#8217;re into that kind of thing, you can check out <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/app/Stack_Exchange/c1rF4kxgLUzNc-tv0q7g1v8zjc5a1j?country=GLOBAL">the Quantcast stats</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we&#8217;ll come back around to Jay&#8217;s Boring Stuff, aka <b>Community Milestones</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://datascience.stackexchange.com/">Data Science</a> and <a href="http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/">Puzzling</a> were in private beta at the time of this recording, and by the time we posted this, Puzzling had moved to public beta.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now we get to switch over to our <i>Big Meaty Topic</i> for the day. At Stack Exchange (and particularly on Stack Overflow), we get a lot of complaints about quality declining on our sites. <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/04/announcing-the-launch-of-meta-stack-exchange/">We split MSO and MSE</a>, which gave people a chance to talk about their feelings (which is what we intended) and gave rise to questions like &#8220;<a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/251758/why-is-stack-overflow-so-negative-of-late">Why is Stack Overflow so negative of late?</a>&#8220;. It got a lot of interesting answers and comments.</p>
<p>Essentially, we are scaring legitimate, thoughtful people away from getting help. That&#8217;s one side of the problem. Additionally, some of our best users are getting more frustrated than we want them to be and (importantly) expressing that <b>it&#8217;s hard for them to find questions that they want to answer</b>. That part is something we can actually do something about.</p>
<p>Joel has two very very simple proposals to solve this problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>When a question gets upvoted by a user with <i>x</i> reputation (or maybe just upvoted), that upvote buys it <i>y</i> more impressions on the front page than the standard rate. Demonstrably good questions get more eyeballs than questions that haven&#8217;t been demonstrated to be good.</li>
<li>Users that are relatively trusted by the system get more impressions on the front page for their questions. If you have a couple hundred reputation and you seem like a trusted user, your question gets more eyeballs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Better questions get more eyeballs and therefore have a better chance of being answered well. Tune in for extensive discussion of the nuances and issues involved in Question Neutrality.</p>

Let&#8217;s kick things off with Community Milestones (assuming Joel knows where he is).

Joomla!

IHOP dot com is a Joomla! site.


Unrelated: Donald Knuth mentioned our TeX site in a recent TUGboat.
Earth Science

Why do snowflakes form into hexagonal structures?
What is the status of the Raymo &#38; Ruddiman idea that Tibet cooled the Earth?
Joel had a rock computer when he was a kid. We&#8217;re not sure that&#8217;s a real thing. (UPDATE: it is!)


Academia has graduated and has a beautiful new design, thanks to designer Stéphane Martin.

New Features

The iPhone app is coming! [Ed: it has now been released!]
We&#8217;re also working on instant automagical refresh in the apps.
The MSO/MSE split happened! But we already talked about it.
We&#8217;re busy breaking Super User by trying to migrate it over to CloudFlare.
Coming soon&#8230; Careers 2.0 City Pages!

Community of the Week: Travel

Why do people on airplanes often have tomato juice as a drink?
OK we&#8217;re all adults here, so really, how on earth should I use a squat toilet?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, we announced the release of our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/01/stack-exchange-for-android-is-here/">Android application</a> and the public feedback was fantastic. Well, it turns out we offended our designers by not doing an iPhone application too. So, after spending the last few months apologizing and bribing them (turns out designers love moleskins in pantone colors), we&#8217;re excited to announce the release of Stack Exchange for your iPhone.</p>
<p><a title="Stack Exchange on App Store" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stack-exchange/id871299723" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gbyay.png" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Feed Me, Seymour</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">At the heart of our mobile applications is <strong>The Feed</strong> which gives you a deeply personalized selection of content customized to what’s relevant to you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It includes any new answers, comments, or upvotes on your posts, and even new questions we think you’d like based on your previous activity. It basically does all the hard work to make it so you always have something interesting waiting for you a tap on a blue icon away. Since it&#8217;s personalized, try not to judge me based on how nerdy the following sample is:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3evjS.png" /></p>
<h2>Real time feedback</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Stack Exchange for iPhone sends you instant notifications any time someone interacts with you, so when you urgently need to figure out how long cooked chicken lasts in the fridge (turns out, a couple days) you’ll get a notification the second someone answers your question.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/47NTm.png" /></p>
<p>And you can always customize the notifications in your iPhone&#8217;s built in Settings, in case you don&#8217;t want to get a message in the middle of the night (and end up dreaming of chicken).</p>
<h2>Like Stack Exchange on your computer, but better.</h2>
<p dir="ltr">You can ask, answer, comment, and vote, and there&#8217;s even a built-in Markdown keyboard. Plus, you can upload images straight from your device.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZuFS8.png" /></p>
<p>The next time <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/04/podcast-57-we-just-saw-this-on-florp/">you want to identify a cool font you see on a poster</a>, you can immediately post a question with a picture of it from your iPhone.</p>
<h2>What about feature [...]?</h2>
<p>While the application currently has some awesome features, it doesn&#8217;t have everything. If you find something wrong or missing, please let us know. Use your fancy new app to post a question on <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/tags/ios-app" target="_blank">Meta using the ios-app tag</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are already <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios-app+feature-request+-status-completed?sort=votes">some great suggestions</a>, and while we’re currently working on a dedicated tablet interface for both iPads and Android, the urgency of our iPhone improvements will be pretty closely related to the vote count of posts on meta.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking of which, we&#8217;d like to give a huge thanks to the awesome people who answered our call to arms (well, thumbs) to test this application, and who provided us with great feedback (including the list of suggestions above).</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, what are you waiting for? Go download Stack Exchange on your iPhone now and you’ll  never have to wait until you get back home to <a href="http://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identify-this-movie">figure out “What was that movie with the guy and that thing?” again</a>!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" title="Stack Exchange on App Store" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stack-exchange/id871299723" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gbyay.png" /></a></p>

We have lots to talk about (which makes Joel scared), starting with Community Milestones (after we discuss 2048 strategy, that is)!

Expats is newly in public beta. It&#8217;s a site for people that are dealing with the bureaucratic messes involved in living outside your home country. Check out their top-voted questions.

Can I lose my US citizenship for accepting employment within a foreign government?
How do I deal with PPACA (&#8220;Obamacare&#8221;) as an expatriate?
How to build credit history in the USA?
Tax residency when in the EU for less than 6 months


And we&#8217;ve added yet another math site to the network: Math Educators.
Graphic Design has graduated from public beta, and it now has its own beautiful design &#8211; check it out! (It&#8217;s a great site, but it also helps Jay do things like this.)

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever seen this diagram?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.sstatic.net/Img/about/venn-diagram.png" width="300" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the visual <a title="n. a dark, sticky substance used to keep elevators from leaking noxious entrepreneurs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch">elevator pitch</a> for Stack Exchange. We were the little dot in the middle, a potent mix of useful traits from other tools, a wiry mutt full of hybrid vigor. The purpose of this blend was to allow and <i>encourage</i> the construction of a library of solutions, by providing communities with the tools they needed to share their experiences and challenges with others who might struggle with the same issues.</p>
<p>The diagram illustrated where we <s>stole</s> drew inspiration for the design of those tools, and their influence occasionally shows up in the results. Sometimes, a question will end up more like a wiki, other times more like a blog, other times more like a discussion. Because of these roots, we’ve never been too stuck on the <i><a title="question number one: have you ever asked a question just to see if others felt as you do?" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr2bSL5VQgM">purity</a></i> of the idea of Q&amp;A: over time, when communities using this software needed to deviate a bit, we’ve tried to build in features to give them what they needed to help solve more problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users wanted to “blog” about questions where they’d already found solutions, so we introduced <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/05/encyclopedia-stack-exchange/">self-answered questions</a></li>
<li>People occasionally found themselves needing ongoing discussion to solve a problem, so we added <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/stack-overflow-chat-now-live/">chat forums</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230;And sometimes, folks realized that they needed a <i>bunch</i> of people to contribute meaningfully to create a post. Not just the collaborative, minor editing that occurs on most questions here; these were cases where multiple users needed to pitch in <i>just to do a topic justice.</i> But there were two points of friction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Originally, most users couldn’t edit others’ posts, (we didn’t have suggested edits yet)</li>
<li>It’s hard to ask people to put a lot of effort into creating something together when the asker is going to keep all the credit <i>and</i> all the reputation. I don’t care about rep and attribution when I’m self-motivated to improve a post I come across, but it feels different when someone outright asks me to pitch in while intending to keep <i>all the fake internet points for themselves!</i></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s where Community Wiki came in &#8211; it killed those friction points by eliminating rep generation from those posts and lowering the bar on who could edit them. Which made it much easier for people who wanted to create collaborative, ensemble works &#8211; <a title="...ripe, well-aged..." href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/">true community owned <i>and</i> edited resources</a>.</p>
<p>But, much like dynamite, this well-intentioned invention was quickly weaponized into an instrument of destruction. Our big mistake: thinking we could systematically <i>detect</i> when such collaboration was happening, and automatically convert those posts to Community Wiki. It sounded awesome &#8211; “we’ll help you collaborate <i>even more!</i> When we see enough editors, we’ll save you the trouble of making it community wiki yourself and do it for you…”</p>
<p><b>Yeah, we are dumb.</b></p>
<h2 title="Just for a change of pace, not as a permanent commitment">In which we stop being dumb</h2>
<p>By using ridiculously simplistic heuristics to detect these scenarios, we turned what should have been an act of generosity &#8211; an invitation to the community to participate in building a shared resource &#8211; into a hidden pitfall for the unwary. Too many helpers? <i>NO ONE GETS CREDIT!!!</i> It was a system that converted helpfulness and generosity into a slap in the face &#8211; <i>from a robot.</i></p>
<p><img title="the other hand is full of stolen Cheetos" alt="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BIcgo.png" width="300" /></p>
<p>Therefore, <b>we have removed all automatic Wiki conversion triggers from the software.</b> No longer will answers with more than some arbitrary number of edits, or questions with more than a page of answers suddenly lose their owners. To handle those rare situations where unusual activity levels may indicate <i>misuse</i>, we’ve added some new moderator flags in these scenarios: they can respond <i>when necessary</i> by closing or locking the post &#8211; but when there is no fire behind the smoke, they can silently dismiss the flag without disruption.</p>
<h2>The once again future of Community Wiki</h2>
<p>An author can still apply the status manually when posting or when editing their own answer, and moderators retain the ability to apply it when they deem it truly necessary (for instance, a question attracting <i>very</i> large numbers of partial answers can be a sign of a topic that <i>wants</i> to be a wiki). For the most part, we’ve turned it back into something that <i>you can choose to use in cases where it lets you work together to create something wonderful:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/100360/how-do-i-get-rid-of-malicious-spyware-malware-viruses-or-rootkits-from-my-pc">Compiling a canonical reference</a></li>
<li><a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/496139/something-is-burning-in-the-server-room-how-can-i-quickly-identify-what-it-is/496284#496284">Consolidating the knowledge of the community</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1253683/what-browsers-support-html5-websocket-api/2700609#2700609">Encouraging the ongoing, active maintenance of a changing answer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes these are single, collaborative answers, other times questions where all contributions must be made in the form of edits. In <i>all</i> cases, the results are clearly that of a sum greater than the whole of its parts, a true <i>community</i> project.</p>
<p><img title="rare image of the Lounge working on The Definitive C++ Book Guide and List" alt="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3nTI3.png" width="400" /><br />
<small><i>source: <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Barn_raising_in_Lansing.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></i></small></p>
<p>Collaboration isn’t a rare thing on our network &#8211; the whole system, from posting and editing to voting to moderation, is based on the interaction of multiple users to produce a final product. Community wiki is for a special scenario, something built not by the expertise of one individual, then improved or iterated on by a few others, but rather something created by the concerted efforts of <i>the community as a whole.</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re very pleased to announce that as of today, we’re (finally) splitting the site formerly known as Meta Stack Overflow into two sites:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com">Meta Stack Overflow</a></strong> is a brand-spanking new site for discussions specific to the Stack Overflow (programming) community:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Meta-Stack-Overflow.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14637 aligncenter" alt="Meta Stack Overflow" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Meta-Stack-Overflow.png" style="border:1px solid #000;"/></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com">Meta Stack Exchange</a></strong> will cover feature requests, bugs, and any discussion topics that affect the entire network:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Meta-Stack-Exchange.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14639 aligncenter" alt="Meta Stack Exchange" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Meta-Stack-Exchange.png" style="border:1px solid #000;" /></a></p>
<p>Meta has always been one of the most important things that make our network… work. Almost all of our most important features, improvements, and community rules were partly or entirely based on our users telling us how we could help you help more people. Hell, even the idea of Meta itself came from the community &#8211; and we fought it hard before we realized how right you guys were. But meta has always had two key functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Local governance &#8211; communities have to decide what’s on- and off- topic, what tags to use, and how to deal with topic-specific guidelines like how sources should be cited.</li>
<li>Federal law and product feedback &#8211; Most changes to the engine affect all sites, and some guidelines and rules (“be nice”) are the same network wide.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s why every site except Stack Overflow has always had its own meta site, so it could focus on the “local governance” issues that were specific to that community. But as the network has grown, many users have shown enthusiasm not just about the sites where they participate, but also about how the whole system should work. It&#8217;s time to give these discussions a place of their own.</p>
<p>Prior to today, Meta Stack Overflow doubled as the home of both discussions about broad network changes, and discussions around the unique issues that Stack Overflow faces (often due to its enormous scale). The percent of problems Stack Overflow shares with its smaller sister sites has become exceedingly low, which has created an awkward dissonance when it comes to how folks perceive and approach challenges.</p>
<p>For example, some new sites embrace the idea of highly specific, narrowly-scoped questions that seek product recommendations, – something that is <em>perfectly</em> acceptable to explore on many sites but completely off-limits on Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>Someone else might be interested in strategies to better promote and grow new sites when they come out of private beta, which might apply to many network sites, but is obviously a problem that the Stack Overflow community is not facing. The scale of Stack Overflow puts an interesting twist on almost every discussion that the Stack Overflow community has; they needed a place of their own to work on their own challenges. Similarly, someone outside of the Stack Overflow community that wants to propose a new feature isn&#8217;t likely to be super interested in XML tag synonyms.</p>
<p>When you visit Meta Stack Exchange, you’ll see that the split is still a a work in progress. We&#8217;re in the process of migrating quite a few Stack Overflow specific discussions that are still relevant and unresolved, to help to show the kind of topics that belong on the new MSO. Over time we&#8217;ll continue to migrate discussions that clearly belong on Meta Stack Overflow back over the fence.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the nuts and bolts and mechanics of the split itself (such as how rep is going to work, moderators, etc), <a title="Stack Overflow Is Getting A Place Of Its Own" href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/212631/stack-overflow-is-getting-a-place-of-its-own">have a look at the initial project announcement</a>. The plan was extremely simple, and we stuck to it.</p>
<p>Now, we realize that we weren&#8217;t exactly hurting for “more challenges in figuring out where to put my post”. That’s why we’re making this really simple:</p>
<p><strong>When in doubt, you can always post your question on your local meta. If it’s clearly relevant to the engine or network as a whole, we’ll move it.</strong></p>
<p>You can always find your local meta right under the main site in the site switcher in the upper left corner of the site:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/urV64.png" width="379" height="158" style="border: 1px solid #000;"/></p>
<p>If you have any input or ideas to share, <em>just go right to your favorite site&#8217;s meta and do it there</em>; there&#8217;s no need for you to go to Meta Stack Exchange at all.</p>
<p>That said, any time you know your question applies to the the whole network, you&#8217;re of course perfectly welcome to participate on Meta Stack Exchange directly.</p>
<p>The largest beneficiary of this split is probably the Stack Overflow community; our flagship site went without a town hall all of its own for way too long. Splitting the two opens up many more possibilities while alleviating noise for everyone.</p>
<p>Young sites don&#8217;t generally have, and may <em>never</em> have the sorts of challenges that Stack Overflow did. Now, there&#8217;s a place for our smaller communities to come together and figure out what works for <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>Do you have some great ideas that could make quite a few communities even better? Take them to your site&#8217;s own little town hall, or feel free to bring them to <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com" target="_blank">the capital city</a> directly. Do you have ideas that suit the scale of Stack Overflow? Well then, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/cmon-get-meta/">c&#8217;mon, get meta</a>, as it was intended.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/06/new-protected-question-status/">Protected status</a> is an often-overlooked feature of Stack Exchange. It&#8217;s based loosely on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Rough_guide_to_semi-protection">Wikipedia&#8217;s semi-protection</a>, and like that tool is meant to be a <em>reaction</em> to persistent abuse from anonymous or unproven participants: when a page attracts a lot of noise or vandalism from outside the community, Protecting it reduces the amount of clean-up needed later on. </p>
<p>Protected questions are not answerable by folks who haven&#8217;t earned at least 10 reputation from activity <em>on the site where the question resides</em>. This effectively means you need to have posted an answer somewhere else that&#8217;s attracted an up-vote or a question that&#8217;s earned two.</p>
<p>Originally, this functionality was limited to moderators, but during the past several years we&#8217;ve made a few changes to encourage more productive use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/protect-questions">Privileged users</a> can protect <em>and unprotect</em> any question over a day old. Previous unprotect restrictions lifted <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/226619/auto-protect-questions-that-get-more-than-n-answers-from-new-users-in-a-24-hour/228805#228805">as of today</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>The system (in the guise of the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/-1/community">Community user</a>) will automatically protect questions that&#8217;ve had either</p>
<ol>
<li>3 answers from new users deleted &#8211; this handles questions that tend to attract large amounts of spam over time.</li>
<li>5<sup>*</sup> answers from new users scoring <= 0 posted in the past 24 hours - this handles questions that are somewhat topical, and are attracting large numbers of "participants" who aren't actually contributing anything useful. This is also new <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/226619/auto-protect-questions-that-get-more-than-n-answers-from-new-users-in-a-24-hour/228805#228805">as of today</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><small><sup>*</sup>This value can be higher or lower on sites that have demonstrated &#8220;special&#8221; patterns of new-user interaction.</small></p>
<h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines for Protecting questions:<a href="#guidelines" title="Permalink to this section" style="font-size:x-small;vertical-align: super">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Do</strong> protect questions that are attracting a lot of non-answers or very poor answers (spam, etc.) <strong>from new users.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t</strong> protect questions just because they&#8217;re linked to on a high-traffic news site like Reddit or Ars Technica. While there&#8217;s certainly some correlation between sudden spikes in popularity and associated non-answers, not all popular questions suffer from this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do</strong> <i>unprotect</i> questions that aren&#8217;t currently attracting a lot of attention and don&#8217;t have a <em>long</em> history of unproductive answers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Judicious use of this feature is critical to allowing these sites to handle large amounts of external attention, but <em>over-using it</em> breaks the system: Stack Exchange sites depend on a constant influx of new blood, both to answer new questions and provide updated information on old ones. When in doubt, err on the side of letting new users prove themselves before locking them out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Stack Exchange Podcast #56 recorded on Thursday, March 6th 2014, aka the 4th of Adar II 5774, aka the second day of Lent. Today&#8217;s podcast is sponsored by Patent Trolls of America. Today&#8217;s guest is Micah Siegel, Senior Patent Advisor at Stack Exchange and Professor Emeritus at Stanford.</p>
<p>But first, <strong>Community Milestones</strong>!</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ve already talked at length about <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/10/podcast-53-lets-go-rio/" target="_blank">The Workplace</a>, but it should be noted that the Workplace community has just graduated. They are now a fully-fledged site, so go check out their design!</li>
<li><a href="http://arduino.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">Arduino</a> is our newest public beta site. (An Arduino is a tiny little computer board thing, according to Jay.) We&#8217;ve tried it in the past and didn&#8217;t have enough activity, but this iteration is looking much stronger and we&#8217;re excited to see where it will go. Also, <a href="http://day.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">March 29th is Arduino Day</a>.</li>
<li>At long, long last, <a href="http://money.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">Personal Finance &amp; Money</a> has graduated. We love money! Longtime beleaguered designer Jin finally has assistance on his design team, so we are working through the backlog of graduated site designs.</li>
</ul>
<p>To commemorate Money&#8217;s graduation, we&#8217;ve made it <b>Community of the Week</b>. Here are some of the cool questions we discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/1625/best-way-to-start-investing-for-a-young-person-just-starting-their-career" target="_blank">Best way to start investing for a young person just starting their career?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/14696/in-a-competitive-market-why-is-movie-theater-popcorn-expensive" target="_blank">In a competitive market, why is movie theater popcorn expensive?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/1767/why-does-gold-have-value" target="_blank">Why does gold have value?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This site grew out of an SE 1.0 site on the same topic, and it&#8217;s therefore one of our oldest sites. Check it out!</p>
<p>Next up, we have <strong>New Features</strong>. Or, we don&#8217;t, because we haven&#8217;t done anything, and David is demoted. Just kidding: we do!</p>
<ul>
<li>We added the ability to <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/03/your-communities-list-is-now-customizable/" target="_blank">customize your list of communities</a> in the top bar switcher.</li>
<li>We made some tweaks to the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/review" target="_blank">close vote review queue on Stack Overflow</a> in an attempt to get it down from approximately nine billion flags. You can also sort by tag (or type of close vote), which you could always do, but now it&#8217;s much more visible. <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/223497/lets-burn-down-the-close-queue/" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s how it works.</a></li>
<li>Work is ongoing on our mobile apps, as always. Reminder: you can <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stackexchange.marvin" target="_blank">download our Android app</a> or <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/220264/help-us-test-the-alpha-version-of-our-ios-app" target="_blank">sign up to alpha test our iOS app</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay! Let&#8217;s talk patents! (Jay loves them, but David says they&#8217;re the worst.) It&#8217;s been a year since we started the <a href="http://askpatents.com/" target="_blank">Ask Patents</a> project. Joel walks us through why we got into this area in the first place, and we fixed the problem. Done. Solved! (Kinda.) It&#8217;s confusing, because code is both copyrightable and patentable. About 7% of the patent applications submitted to the USPTO are what we call problematic. We decided to pick out the ones we are most concerned about and <a href="http://patents.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/prior-art-request" target="_blank">post them on the site</a> for our communities to peruse and choose prior art. Micah talks through how we chose the patent applications to post, and how it&#8217;s been going. (Fun fact: we are the first entity to get a YouTube video accepted as prior art!)</p>
<ul>
<li>By the way, here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/05/31/187374157/episode-462-when-patents-hit-the-podcast" target="_blank">Planet Money podcast</a> Joel was talking about.</li>
</ul>
<p>We came up with a hack about six months ago to help us make this process scale. Instead of filling out the janky confusing form, we simply started emailing the relevant Ask Patents link <i>directly to the patent examiner</i>. Magic!</p>
<p>So is it working? We&#8217;ve proven as far as we can tell that if we target a bad application and put enough eyes from Stack Overflow on it, we&#8217;ll get good prior art. We know how all of the numbers break down: exactly how many people on Stack Overflow have to see the bad software patent in order for us to get enough prior art that enough of it will be <i>good</i> enough prior art to trigger an email to the patent examiner.</p>
<p>What can people do right now if they want to make a difference? Go find some <a href="http://patents.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/prior-art-request" target="_blank">prior art requests</a> and post prior art to help us destroy some patents. (Also, you can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/askpatents" target="_blank">Ask Patents on Twitter</a>.)</p>
<p>Micah is consulting for a few other companies on patent issues, so you can <a href="mailto:msiegel@askpatents.com" target="_blank">contact him</a> if your company wants to pick his brain. He knows a lot about the current Supreme Court case that might outlaw software patents altogether (but not for a long time).</p>

		<itunes:summary>Welcome to the Stack Exchange Podcast #56 recorded on Thursday, March 6th 2014, aka the 4th of Adar II 5774, aka the second day of Lent. Today&#8217;s podcast is sponsored by Patent Trolls of America. Today&#8217;s guest is Micah Siegel, Senior Patent Advisor at Stack Exchange and Professor Emeritus at Stanford.
But first, Community Milestones!

We&#8217;ve already talked at length about The Workplace, but it should be noted that the Workplace community has just graduated. They are now a fully-fledged site, so go check out their design!
Arduino is our newest public beta site. (An Arduino is a tiny little computer board thing, according to Jay.) We&#8217;ve tried it in the past and didn&#8217;t have enough activity, but this iteration is looking much stronger and we&#8217;re excited to see where it will go. Also, March 29th is Arduino Day.
At long, long last, Personal Finance &#38; Money has graduated. We love money! Longtime beleaguered designer Jin finally has assistance on his design team, so we are working through the backlog of graduated site designs.

To commemorate Money&#8217;s graduation, we&#8217;ve made it Community of the Week. Here are some of the cool questions we discussed:

Best way to start investing for a young person just starting their career?
In a competitive market, why is movie theater popcorn expensive?
Why does gold have value?

This site grew out of an SE 1.0 site on the same topic, and it&#8217;s therefore one of our oldest sites. Check it out!
Next up, we have New Features. Or, we don&#8217;t, because we haven&#8217;t done anything, and David is demoted. Just kidding: we do!

We added the ability to customize your list of communities in the top bar switcher.
We made some tweaks to the close vote review queue on Stack Overflow in an attempt to get it down from approximately nine billion flags. You can also sort by tag (or type of close vote), which you could always do, but now it&#8217;s much more visible. Here&#8217;s how it works.
Work is ongoing on our mobile apps, as always. Reminder: you can download our Android app or sign up to alpha test our iOS app.

Okay! Let&#8217;s talk patents! (Jay loves them, but David says they&#8217;re the worst.) It&#8217;s been a year since we started the Ask Patents project. Joel walks us through why we got into this area in the first place, and we fixed the problem. Done. Solved! (Kinda.) It&#8217;s confusing, because code is both copyrightable and patentable.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A few months ago, we rolled out <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/12/a-new-top-bar-for-stack-exchange/">a new top bar</a> for all of the Stack Exchange communities. The mission was consistency: Every community gets the same Stack Exchange brand at the top, the same navigation between sites, and the same live updates about new inbox items and reputation changes</p>
<p dir="ltr">But we realize that not everybody uses Stack Exchange the same way. Some people focus on one community, others participate in several, and more than a few spend a lot of time lurking now that we have <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">116 different sites</a> to choose from.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s why, <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/215928/custom-ordering-for-stack-exchange-all-sites-dropdown">as promised</a>, we have made the “Your communities” section of the Stack Exchange drop-down <strong>fully customizable</strong> so you can keep all of your favorite communities right at the top.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone" alt="Edit link" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jbt2w.png" width="389" height="432" /></p>
<h2>Here’s how it works:</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Customizing this list is completely optional. If you do nothing, you will keep the defaults: your top five communities by reputation.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Edit mode" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/69r4y.png" width="361" height="257" align="right" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">But click the edit button and the default rules no longer apply. Instead, you can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a community to the list by typing the name and clicking Add</li>
<li>Repeat #1 to add as many as you want</li>
<li>Change the order of communities in the list by clicking and dragging</li>
<li>Click the Save button to apply your changes!</li>
</ol>
<p><br clear="all"></p>
<p>You can reset the list to the default at any time, so try it out! Then drop by <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/215928/custom-ordering-for-stack-exchange-all-sites-dropdown">the Meta post</a> to share your thoughts and feedback.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast #55, recorded on <del>Friday</del> Thursday the 13th with your hosts Joel Spolsky, David Fullerton, and Jay Hanlon! Today&#8217;s episode is brought to you by the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sochi">Sochi, Russia</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s been a long time since we last recorded, so we have a lot to talk about, and we&#8217;re going to skip most of it. First we&#8217;re going to talk about all our brand new sites, so Joel learn about them for the first time.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pets.stackexchange.com/">Pets</a> is a site for (you guessed it) pet owners to wonder <a href="http://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/2202/why-is-my-cat-so-interested-in-me-making-the-bed">why their cats like to watch them making the bed</a>. Also, we already talked about this site. Moving on!</li>
<li>We also launched <a href="http://italian.stackexchange.com/">Italian</a>, which is very high quality but unfortunately very slow so far.</li>
<li>Jay thought <a href="http://ebooks.stackexchange.com/">Ebooks</a> would be awful, but it has turned out to be extremely high quality and high engagement.</li>
<li><a href="http://beer.stackexchange.com/">Hooray, beer</a>! Our new Beer site is somehow different from <a href="http://homebrew.stackexchange.com/">Homebrew</a>, so Joel quits.</li>
<li>We launched a Relationships &amp; Dating site, but we broke up with it pretty quickly because it generated too many bad &#8220;commitment&#8221; jokes (and because the topic was a hard fit for our engine).</li>
<li>We launched <a href="http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/">a site for software recommendations</a>. And discussed it at <i>length</i>. The good parts version: it&#8217;s going much better than expected.</li>
<li>We almost forgot to talk about <a href="http://aviation.stackexchange.com/">Aviation</a>! It launched a while back, and it is a slam dunk for our engine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&#8217;s time for our Site of the Week! (This week was apparently four months long.) Let&#8217;s talk about <a href="http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/">Code Golf</a>. It&#8217;s a site for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf">code golf</a> (unsurprisingly!). Links discussed:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/6043/were-no-strangers-to-code-golf-you-know-the-rules-and-so-do-i">We&#8217;re no strangers to code golf</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/18986/draw-the-olympic-games-logo">Draw the Olympics logo</a></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128">Commodore 128</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> is a thing (though sort of irrelevant to Code Golf).</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">We already <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/11/podcast-54-the-one-with-all-the-anachronisms/">talked at length</a> about the new topbar, but it has bred some interesting changes to other areas of our pages. For example: when we moved Hot Questions out of the MultiCollider and into the sidebar, Code Golf started getting huge boosts on their most interesting questions (as did other sites with broadly interesting topics). Code Golf is seeing 11-15% more answers due to the traffic coming in from other sites via the Hot Questions sidebar. Neat!</span></li>
<li>So! Let&#8217;s talk about our most exciting new site: <a href="http://pt.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow em Português</a>. Localizing our codebase was a dream of ours for a long time, and we finally did it. It&#8217;s got 1304 perguntas at the time of recording this podcast. (If you want to know more about why we launched a non-English site, check out <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/02/cant-we-all-be-reasonable-and-speak-english/">Jay&#8217;s blog post</a>.) The public beta so far is one of our most successful launches ever.</li>
<li>Also, you can go download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stackexchange.marvin">our Android app</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/forms/d/18ZDfsBm35cV72Gzf88zPaMLQwrSRPwP2__RnPb-uqTs/viewform">sign up to test our iOS app</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for joining us for Stack Exchange Podcast #55, sponsored by the city of Sochi, Russia &#8211; don&#8217;t forget to visit the Friendship Tree. See you next time!</p>

So! Let&#8217;s talk about our most exciting new site: Stack Overflow em Português. Localizing our codebase was a dream of ours for a long time, and we finally did it. It&#8217;s got 1304 perguntas at the time of recording this podcast. (If you want to know more about why we launched a non-English site, check out Jay&#8217;s blog post.) The public beta so far is one of our most successful launches ever.
Also, you can go download our Android app or sign up to test our iOS app.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2013, our Stack Overflow community grew from 21.5 million to 26.9 million monthly visitors from 242 countries around the world. We&#8217;re doing a lot to keep growing with the community &#8212; we now have localized versions of Careers 2.0 for French and German audiences, we&#8217;re developing <a title="Still in alpha - sign up if you wanna help break stuff!" href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/220264/help-us-test-the-alpha-version-of-our-ios-app">iOS</a> and <a title="In Beta - still breaky, less achy" href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/2014/01/stack-exchange-for-android-is-here/">Android</a> mobile apps for our entire network, and our first ever <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/02/cant-we-all-be-reasonable-and-speak-english/">localized</a> version of Stack Overflow with <a href="http://pt.stackoverflow.com/">the Portuguese site</a> currently in beta. As a way for us to make sure we&#8217;re doing the most for our users and community on Stack Overflow, we conduct a survey every year to see what you&#8217;re up to, how you&#8217;re using our site and what else is on your mind. This year, we analyzed a survey sample of 7,500 responses from 96 countries. As a thank you for the time you spent filling it out, we donated an additional $12,000 to our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/12/stack-exchange-gives-back-2013-2/">Stack Exchange Charities</a>.</p>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<p><b style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">This is the second year we’re calling out mobile, and yes mobile is still growing.</b></p>
<p>While only 7.9% of you classified your occupation as a Mobile Application Developer, the majority of respondents (51.5%!) said that their company has a native mobile app. This is an increase from 2012 when 48.2% of respondents had a mobile app.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">Android continues to climb while iPhone declines</b></p>
<p>Not only is the Android Phone the most popular mobile device with 63.8% of respondents saying they have one, the most popular native mobile platform supported is an Android Phone app with 39.5%. The iPhone lost more traction with developers this year with 30.7% of respondents saying they own an iPhone compared to 35.2% in 2012.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">Working Remotely</b></p>
<p>As our Stack Exchange team is growing and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/02/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/">we have more employees working remote</a>, we added a number of questions about remote work. While only 10.6% of respondents said they are full-time remote, 63.9% of total respondents say they work remotely at least occasionally.</p>
<p>Here’s a special infographic to sum up our survey findings. If you’d like to do your own analysis you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16C6ZeNSvd-qIg45J9E-vx2YCsD8w5oZaSTUtJ-52e-w/edit?usp=sharing">download the survey results</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago, we announced the public launch of <a href="http://pt.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow in Portuguese</a>, our first-ever non-English Stack Overflow community. Which raises one very obvious question:</p>
<p><strong>Have we lost our minds?</strong></p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t the whole point of Stack Overflow to aggregate as much developer knowledge as possible <em>in one place?</em> To get all the potential solutions <em>together</em>, and provide one canonical set of answers?</p>
<div id="attachment_14476" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/800px-Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Tower_of_Babel_Vienna_-_Google_Art_Project_-_edited.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14476  " alt="" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/800px-Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Tower_of_Babel_Vienna_-_Google_Art_Project_-_edited-300x219.jpg" width="300" height="219" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We are aware that, &#8220;Let&#8217;s all try speaking speaking different languages!&#8221; hasn&#8217;t always worked out for the best.</p></div>
<p>Yup. When we set out to &#8220;<a title="The original launch SO announcement." href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/04/introducing-stackoverflow-com.html" target="_blank">collectively increase the sum total of good programming knowledge in the world</a>,&#8221; a big part of the plan was <em>de-fragmenting</em> information previously spread across myriad books, sites, and your brains. It&#8217;s why we mark things as duplicates &#8211; we want all the precious gems of knowledge stored in the same cave of wonders.</p>
<p>So know this: we are at least as worried about fragmentation as you are. And we have a plan:</p>
<p><strong>Eventually, <em>all of you</em> are going to have to learn Portuguese.</strong></p>
<p>Okay, not really. But, given that one of our core goals was knowledge aggregation, it <em>does</em> seem just a little bit crazypants to start launching sites in new languages, assuming that one very important fact is true:</p>
<blockquote><p>Assumption: All of the serious developers in the world are highly proficient in English.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which&#8230; actually sounds plausible. But it&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Not every developer in the world speaks English.</strong> Just reading the comments from our announcement, you&#8217;ll see multiple readers sharing that they or their colleagues (and one dad) couldn&#8217;t participate on SO due to language constraints. But data beat anecdotes. We don&#8217;t have recent numbers for Brazil and Portugal, but we do for China, and they illustrate the same point:
<ul style="margin-top: 15px;">
<li><a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/planet-earth-has-185-million-developers/240165016">10% of the world&#8217;s programmers are in China</a></li>
<li>1.4% of our visits come from China</li>
<li>Only 4.8% of our visits come from China, Japan and Korea <em>combined</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So, if the data tell us that we&#8217;re getting roughly 80% less activity from Asia than we should in the absence of language constraints, why does it feel so obvious that all serious programmers speak English?  This may help:</p>
<p><strong>Quick &#8211; name any famous developer <em>who doesn&#8217;t write well in English.</em></strong></p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t.  I can name over a dozen famous English-speaking coders. But even if you frequent all the hacker sites and conferences, how many devs have you met who aren&#8217;t solid in English? Roughly none, right?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just one problem. Try this:</p>
<p><strong>Without Googling, name any famous developer from Japan. Or China. Or Russia.</strong></p>
<p>Again, I couldn&#8217;t. Well, I came up with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>. But he&#8217;s apparently a designer. I couldn&#8217;t <em>name</em> even one. Not like I can <em>name</em> Carmack or Stallman, or Hopper, or even &#8220;DHH.&#8221; (Does DHH have an actual name? I personally imagine him as a very handsome, talented, fast-driving set of initials. But I digress.)</p>
<p>Is it plausible that there aren&#8217;t <em>any</em> devs good enough to be famous from those countries? Nope. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s easy to assume that there aren&#8217;t any devs who can&#8217;t speak English because I never see any. But I never see any because I&#8217;m hanging around places where devs go <em>to talk to each other in English</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The startling truth is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the internet, If you don&#8217;t speak English, you&#8217;re completely invisible to me.</p></blockquote>
<p>I also assumed that since developers have to learn English-like syntax, they must speak English. Which is a bit like assuming that because I can order Uni, Hamachi, and Aji by their Japanese names, I could probably toss back some sake with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaharu_Morimoto">Morimoto</a> and discuss knife techniques <em>in Japanese</em>. Even when programming languages use words like &#8220;if&#8221; or &#8220;function,&#8221; they&#8217;re just terms to memorize, and don&#8217;t always even mean the same thing in English that they do in programming.</li>
<li><b>It&#8217;s almost impossible to feel like part of a community if you&#8217;re not <em>highly</em> proficient in the language. </b>Even non-native speakers who are fluent enough to <em>read posts</em> in their second or third languages often aren&#8217;t comfortable enough to <em>write in them</em>.<br />
<blockquote><p>I imagine myself at a professional meetup where <em>everyone</em> is speaking French (which I studied through college). How many jokes would I tell? How many would I even <em>understand</em>? Sure, I can function, and understand all the words, but I don&#8217;t feel like I <em>belong to the group</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; some of our best users aren&#8217;t native English speakers, but they&#8217;re in that rare group who have achieved a far higher mastery of a language than their peers. When I hear,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t need a site like this &#8211; English is my third language, and I&#8217;m in the top 1% on Stack Overflow!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yes, that makes sense. You are insanely good at two difficult, language-based things. Most people will find both of them to be a <em>lot</em> more challenging than you did.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The truth is, by requiring fluency in English, we&#8217;re shutting out of a lot of developers who may know enough English to read it but not enough to feel comfortable participating.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Requiring that all aspiring devs &#8220;just go learn English&#8221; <em>first</em> isn&#8217;t who we want to be.</strong></strong>
<div id="attachment_14483" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Griff3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-14483" alt="No child should be denied their chance to revolutionize tomorrow's input technologies." src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Griff3-300x215.jpg" width="300" height="215" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">No child should be denied their chance to revolutionize tomorrow&#8217;s input technologies.</p></div>
<p>Even if I believed that every programmer <em>must</em> eventually master English, it still wouldn&#8217;t make any sense to make them do it <em>first</em>. I believe that everyone &#8211; everyone &#8211; who can really fall in love with programming should get a chance to. So pre-filtering for the ones willing to <em>learn a foreign freaking language</em> before they first sit down with a code editor to see if it lights some spark in them just feels wrong.Think of the children. The children!! Okay, last quiz, just for the native English speakers:</p>
<p><strong>How old were you when you first realized you could type things on a keyboard and <em>control machines?</em> Great. Now, at that age, were you proficient enough in another language to have learned to code <em>without any English?</em></strong></p>
<p>When I tell someone I work at Stack Exchange, my absolute favorite response is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I basically learned to code from posts I found on Stack Overflow&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We want that for every young programmer. Not just the ones lucky enough to be born somewhere that English gets taught in grammar school.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Okay, that all makes <em>some</em> sense. But why Portuguese?</strong></p>
<p>To be clear, we <em>still</em> don&#8217;t think there needs to be a Stack Overflow in every language. We do want as much centralization as possible, and we know that devs who <em>have</em> mastered English will mostly keep going to the English site, since it has the most critical mass. Just like we want them to. So, you won&#8217;t need to learn new languages to find good answers &#8211; we expect almost every question asked on the Portuguese site to <b>also</b> be asked (and answered) on the English site.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re really only considering launching sites in languages that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have large, strong communities of high-talent developers, where</li>
<li>A meaningful percent of them aren&#8217;t comfortable enough to participate in an English-only community</li>
</ul>
<p>That probably limits the list of potential candidates to Mandarin, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, and Spanish. <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">From there, Portuguese was a no-brainer. The developer community in Brazil is awesome, and growing fast. And we wanted to start with a language with a similar alphabet, to minimize the localization work.</span></p>
<p><strong>And it&#8217;s worth a shot</strong>. We&#8217;ve learned that it&#8217;s easier to just watch the future than to try to predict it. So we&#8217;re big on just trying stuff out (assuming it can&#8217;t break our other stuff). And we&#8217;re huge on getting stuff crazy-wrong, <del>refusing to admit it, and instead doubling down on our wrong-minded idea, while nodding crazily</del> er&#8230; admitting we made a mistake, and reversing course. So, given the number of user requests, we figured, &#8220;why <strong>not</strong> give it a it a try?&#8221; We&#8217;re committed to supporting one or two languages and seeing how they develop before we push any further.</p>
<p>And so far, it&#8217;s an <em>incredible</em> success. Despite an audience limited to portuguese-speaking devs, the site&#8217;s activity in its first week was higher than all but 4 out of 120 sites we&#8217;ve launched to date, including the original trilogy.</p>
<p>More importantly, people who couldn&#8217;t ask questions are asking them, and getting great answers. When in doubt, we want to err on the side of helping more people. If just one little girl in Brazil sticks with programming because an answer on this site helped her finish her first project, well&#8230; <em><strong>that&#8217;s not good enough! </strong></em><strong> </strong>I want to help thousands of them. And the boys, too.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s a good start.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of excitement lately here at Stack Exchange, what with the launch of our <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/2014/01/stack-exchange-for-android-is-here/">Android app</a> and the start of our <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/220264/help-us-test-the-alpha-version-of-our-ios-app">iOS app alpha</a>.  A few sharp-eyed users noticed, hidden deep within each app, a new version of the Stack Exchange API. After a few more weeks of testing I&#8217;m happy to say that<strong> V2.2 is now frozen, <a href="http://api.stackexchange.com/docs/">documented</a>, and released</strong>.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s<a href="http://api.stackexchange.com/docs/change-log"> new in this release</a>?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Creating questions and answers</li>
<li>Voting</li>
<li>Editing, Deleting, and Flagging</li>
<li>Improved OAuth UI on mobile devices</li>
<li>…and lots more</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost everything done by our own apps is using our public API, but there are a few notable exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don&#8217;t think the Feed is polished enough for inclusion yet</li>
<li>User creation is too sensitive to guarantee stability</li>
<li>Login methods that don&#8217;t use OAuth can&#8217;t be made public for security reasons</li>
</ul>
<p>With the <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/2012/02/stack-exchange-api-v2-0-no-longer-beta/">third</a> <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/2012/09/stack-exchange-api-v2-1/">release</a> of the API V2.x family, we&#8217;ve decided to retire the V1.x family at long last.  Version 1.0 of the Stack Exchange API was <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/2010/07/stack-exchange-api-1-0-imminent/">released i<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">n 2010</span></a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">, with its last update (V1.1) </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/2011/02/stack-exchange-api-1-1-and-improved-app-gallery/">almost exactly three years ago</a>, and its ultimate <a href="http://stackapps.com/questions/3439/deprecating-api-v1-x">deprecation in 2012</a>. Active consumers were notified of its imminent demise earlier this year, but this is the public announcement:</p>
<h2>V1.0 and V1.1 of the Stack Exchange API will be shut down <span style="text-decoration: underline;">May 12th</span></h2>
<p>I encourage anyone still using the V1.x family to use the coming months to migrate to V2.2. It&#8217;s much improved.</p>

<p>Depois de semanas em beta privado, nós temos o prazer de anunciar que hoje vai ao ar o <a href="http://pt.stackoverflow.com?utm_source=se-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=pt-so-launch&amp;utm_content=pt-so-launch-blog-announcement">nosso primeiro Stack Overflow internacional</a>. E não se trata de um clone em português do site original, mas sim de uma comunidade completamente nova. Uma comunidade que vai poder decidir como ela quer ser, e como vai poder ajudar os desenvolvedores de língua portuguesa.</p>
<p><a href="http://pt.stackoverflow.com/users/login?utm_source=se-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=pt-so-launch&amp;utm_content=pt-so-launch-blog-announcement">Tá esperando o que pra criar sua conta?</a></p>
<p><strong>Sempre quisemos ajudar o máximo possível de pessoas</strong></p>
<p>Quando lançamos o <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow.com</a> (em inglês), a ideia era ter um lugar onde <em>todos</em> os programadores pudessem resolver problemas juntos.</p>
<p>Queríamos um lugar onde desenvolvedores pudessem compartilhar seu conhecimento, num formato melhor do que os fóruns tradicionais. Queríamos que a melhor resposta tivesse destaque e que fosse fácil encontrá-la, tanto para quem perguntou quanto para alguém que pesquisasse sobre o mesmo assunto no futuro.</p>
<p>Construímos um lugar onde a comunidade pode editar e melhorar os posts, votar na melhor solução e trabalhar em conjunto para chegar na melhor resposta. Nosso objetivo era dar <em>à toda comunidade</em> as ferramentas certas e o poder de colaborar e ajudar uns aos outros.</p>
<p><strong>E deu certo.</strong></p>
<p>O Stack Overflow em Inglês tem hoje mais de 6,5 <em>milhões</em> de perguntas, e mais 8 <em>mil</em> delas são criadas todos os dias. Praticamente todas recebem uma resposta correta, que vem logo abaixo da pergunta.</p>
<p>E é a <em>comunidade</em> quem faz tudo isso acontecer. O conteúdo, a edição e até a moderação é feita pelos próprios usuários. Gratuitamente. Porque eles querem ajudar uns aos outros. Ou mostrar uma solução elegante. Ou retribuir a ajuda que receberam.</p>
<p><strong>Mas é preciso saber falar inglês.</strong></p>
<p>Nós não achávamos que o site em uma só língua seria um problema, afinal a maior parte dos programadores fala inglês, né? As próprias linguagens de programação são em inglês, não é mesmo? Mas nos esquecemos de algo muito importante:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Não estávamos escrevendo um manual técnico. <em>Estávamos construindo uma comunidade</em>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Demorou um tempo, mas nós finalmente percebemos o que muitos de vocês já sabiam. É muito difícil fazer parte de uma comunidade que, literalmente, não fala sua língua.</p>
<p><strong>Hoje o dia é dos programadores de língua portuguesa!</strong></p>
<p>Agora vocês tem um lugar só seu, para construir do <em>seu</em> jeito. A melhor parte de participar de um site novo é que há um mundo de possibilidades pela frente:</p>
<p><strong>Se você é jovem ainda, amanhã velho será&#8230; Então aproveite!</strong></p>
<p>As perguntas básicas &#8211; aquelas que um dia atormentaram todo programador &#8211; ainda não foram feitas. Você pode escrever a pergunta ou resposta definitiva, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-an-unsorted-array">que</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/179123/how-do-i-edit-an-incorrect-commit-message-in-git">vai</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/477816/what-is-the-correct-json-content-type">ajudar</a> <em><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1642028/what-is-the-name-of-this-operator">dezenas</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap">de</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/178325/testing-if-something-is-hidden-with-jquery">milhares</a></em> de programadores no futuro. (Ah, e não se preocupe se a sua pergunta já está no site em inglês. Vocês vão construir um site justamente para que os desenvolvedores que falam português não precisem mais recorrer ao inglês para aprender coisas novas!)</p>
<p><strong>Você pode ser o que quiser quando crescer.</strong></p>
<p>Apesar do site ser dedicado à problemas de programação, você pode decidir que sua comunidade realmente precisa, assim como aconteceu com o Stack Overflow. Durante o começo do site, sejam mais liberais quanto a perguntas de recomendação de ferramentas ou bibliotecas, perguntas relevantes à administração de sistemas ou outras áreas de TI.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Por enquanto, se tem a ver com programação, pergunte à vontade.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Por que começar com português?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Nota do tradutor: Porque português é a melhor língua, o Brasil é o melhor país e o Jay não consegue ler o que a gente escreve ;)]</em></p>
<p>Queríamos começar com uma comunidade que atendesse a dois requisitos:</p>
<ul>
<li>Um grande número de desenvolvedores talentosos, em que</li>
<li>Grande parte deles se sentisse muito mais confortável em falar sua própria língua do que o inglês</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-01-28_11-08-04.jpg"><img src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-01-28_11-08-04-1024x505.jpg" alt="2014-01-28_11-08-04" width="1024" height="505" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14435" /></a></p>
<p>Então a escolha foi muito simples. O Brasil conta com uma das maiores e mais fortes comunidades de programação do mundo, e isso sem contar Portugal, Moçambique, Angola e outros países menores que acrescentam ainda mais desenvolvedores talentos a esse grupo.</p>
<p><strong>Esse site é de todos vocês. Vamos construí-lo juntos!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://pt.stackoverflow.com/users/login?utm_source=se-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=pt-so-launch&amp;utm_content=pt-so-launch-blog-announcement">Crie sua conta.</a> Ou <a href="http://pt.stackoverflow.com/tour?utm_source=se-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=pt-so-launch&amp;utm_content=pt-so-launch-blog-announcement">faça o tour</a> (e ganhe sua primeira medalha!)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">This mobile thing will never last, right? We figured if we waited long enough, this whole “mobile application” thing would blow over and everything would go back to the way it used to be. You know, when phones were for calling people, and computers were for typing long, angry rants about how things aren’t the way they used to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XUufS.png" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">In retrospect, we may have misread that one a bit. It turns out that even for Stack Exchange <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bge20/2013-05-bea">mobile is eating the world</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.quantcast.com/p-c1rF4kxgLUzNc"><img alt="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VK557.png" /></a></p>
<p>So today we&#8217;re excited to announce that <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stackexchange.marvin&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Dblog">Stack Exchange for Android</a> is finally available for download on the Google Play store, for Android phones version 4.0 (ICS) and up:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stackexchange.marvin&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Dblog"><br />
<img alt="Get it on Google Play" src="https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_60.png" /><br />
</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">What? You’re an iPhone user? Don’t worry, the iPhone alpha is coming soon, probably in the next <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/19514/146719">six to eight weeks</a>. In fact, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18ZDfsBm35cV72Gzf88zPaMLQwrSRPwP2__RnPb-uqTs/viewform">sign up for the iPhone alpha starting today</a> . We&#8217;ll be inviting people in waves on a first-come, first-served basis over the next few weeks. Meanwhile, keep reading to find out what’s new in the app.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">One Feed to rule them all</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Translating Stack Exchange to mobile was… tricky. We have <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">over 110 communities</a> in the Stack Exchange network. On the web they exist as mostly separate sites. We&#8217;re pretty new to mobile development, but we felt that releasing 110 mobile apps was probably not the right approach.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That meant we had to create an entirely new experience, one that didn&#8217;t exist on the web. A single, central location where you can check in on everything relevant to you across the network, whether you participate on one site or many. We dubbed it (not terribly creatively) “The Feed”. Here’s what it looks like:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/f8008.png" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">This is a completely new feature for Stack Exchange. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Customized recommendations of questions you can answer, based on the sites and tags you participate in</li>
<li dir="ltr">Interesting questions tailored to your interests that will learn from your activity and get better over time</li>
<li dir="ltr">Updates when you get upvoted or your answers get accepted, so you can feel good about helping others wherever you are</li>
<li dir="ltr">All your replies (answers, comments, chat messages, etc.) in one easy timeline</li>
<li dir="ltr">Community events, blog posts, and even recommended jobs for you from Careers</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The Feed scales to your activity: if you’re only participate on one site, it’ll show you mostly questions from that site. If you participate on many, you’ll see all your updates in one convenient place.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Notifications</h1>
<p dir="ltr">We’ve had <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/new-global-inbox/">instant notifications of replies</a> on the site for a while, but now you can take them with you wherever you go. You’ll get notified anytime you would get an inbox message on Stack Exchange, which includes answers, comments, chat replies, and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/j2i7T.png" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Don’t want those notifications? You can easily turn them on and off via settings, including whether they make noise or vibrate. You can even set quiet hours so you don’t get woken in the middle of the night.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Search, Ask, Answer, Comment, and Vote</h1>
<p dir="ltr">And, of course, all the major things you can do on Stack Exchange are fully supported on the app: you can search for questions, ask or answer new questions, leave comments, vote, and even flag or vote to close.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MsMeH.png" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you want, you can configure your phone to automatically open the app when clicking URLs on websites to make getting into the app even easier.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Why Android first? What about iPhone?</h1>
<p dir="ltr">We set out to create a fully native experience for each platform. That meant designing the app twice, once for each platform, to make sure it felt right to users of each. We started with Android mostly because we’re new to mobile, and the Google Play Store process is more forgiving if we make mistakes!</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you’re an iPhone user, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18ZDfsBm35cV72Gzf88zPaMLQwrSRPwP2__RnPb-uqTs/viewform">sign up for the iPhone alpha today</a>! We’ll start inviting alpha testers soon, and hope to launch the iPhone app in a few short months.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">What about tablet / chat / missing feature X?</h1>
<p dir="ltr">This is just the first version, and we plan to keep working on both of the apps in parallel. A tablet optimized version of the app is next, and then we’ll start adding in missing features based on what you tell us we’re missing. So if there’s something you’d like to see in the app, let us know on <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/android-app">Meta under the ‘android-app’ tag</a>.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Let us know how we’re doing</h1>
<p dir="ltr">This is still a work in progress! Take the app for a spin and let us know what you think on <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/android-app">meta</a>. We’ll be working hard to keep improving it over the coming weeks and months. So <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stackexchange.marvin&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Dblog">download it today</a>!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stackexchange.marvin&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Dblog"><br />
<img alt="Get it on Google Play" src="https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_60.png" /><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 dir="ltr"></h1>
<p dir="ltr">We’ve been publishing an <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/stack-overflow-creative-commons-data-dump/">anonymized dump of all user-contributed Stack Exchange content</a> since 2009. Unfortunately, at the end of last year our former host, ClearBits, permanently shut down. So we set out to look for a new home for our data dumps, and today we’re happy to announce that the Internet Archive has agreed to host them:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="margin-bottom: 15px"><a href="https://archive.org/details/stackexchange">The Stack Exchange Data Dump at the Internet Archive</a></h3>
<p dir="ltr">We’ve been big fans of the Internet Archive for a long time, and we’re really happy to be working with them on this.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr" style="margin-bottom: 15px">Wait, what’s this data dump?</h1>
<p dir="ltr">All community-contributed content on Stack Exchange is licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0 license</a>. As part of our commitment to that, we release a quarterly dump of all user-contributed data (after carefully sanitizing it to protect user private data, of course).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Each site can be downloaded individually, and includes an archive with Posts, Users, Votes, Comments, Badges, PostHistory, and PostLinks (new). You’re free (and encouraged!) to share, remix, analyze and build on top of this data any way you want, as long as you follow the attribution requirements.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr" style="margin-bottom: 15px">What are the attribution requirements?</h1>
<p dir="ltr">In keeping with the spirit of sharing and proper attribution, and as the “attribution” part of the CC BY-SA license, we require that you do the following when you use the data:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Visually indicate that the content is from the Stack Exchange network</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Link back to the original source question or answer</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Display the author names for each question and answer you show</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Link back to the author’s user page</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Those links should be ordinary hyperlinks directly to the Stack Exchange site, without “nofollow” or any obfuscation or redirection tricks plainly visible on the page (we’re looking at you, content farms).</p>
<h1 dir="ltr" style="margin-bottom: 15px">I’m too lazy to download this giant zip file. Can’t I just play with it online?</h1>
<p dir="ltr">You’re in luck! We also make the data available through the <a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange Data Explorer</a> (an <a href="https://code.google.com/p/stack-exchange-data-explorer/">open-source project</a> maintained by community member <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/366234/tim-stone">Tim Stone</a>) which lets you run SQL queries directly against a copy of the data. It’s updated weekly, and includes some data that’s not in the data dumps in order to keep the size of the downloads reasonable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you want to access the data programmatically, we also have a pretty expansive <a href="http://api.stackexchange.com/">JSON API</a> that returns similar data to the dumps (but updated in real time with the websites). If you need help, we have <a href="http://stackapps.com/?tab=active">a whole site for people developing apps on top of the API</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So take our data for a spin! We love seeing what people create with it, from <a href="http://stackapps.com/?tab=apps">apps</a> to <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vector/papers/CrowdDoc-GIT-CS-12-05.pdf">research papers</a> or even <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction">machine learning contests</a>. Making this data easily accessible is just our way of giving back to the community that has made Stack Exchange so successful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another holiday season has drawn to a close. We’ve had three glorious weeks with our beloved hats. Now as we pack away the tinsel and the party horns, it’s time to put the hats back in their boxes for another year. Before we move on to 2014 with our bare heads (and our full hearts), let’s take a few moments to reminisce.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="oh the memories" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/uKN0x.png" /></p>
<p><strong><strong>76,586</strong> users</strong> from all over the network earned <strong>214,172</strong><b> hats</b> this year &#8211; that&#8217;s just about twice the number of hats <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/01/boxing-day/">they earned last year</a>. <b>95 sites</b> opted to participate in Winter Bash, which is more than the total number of sites that simply <i>existed</i> during last year’s event.</p>
<p>The most commonly earned hat was the <b>Old Hat</b>, earned 74,631 times (by 35,589 distinct users). The least commonly earned <i>public</i> hat was <b>Oh the Horror</b>, earned just 46 times. And the rarest hat of all was the top-secret <b>Don Draper</b>, earned <b>only 14 times</b> across the whole network.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="hat awardz" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/APoST.png" /></p>
<p>Something new we did this year was keeping the secret hats’ triggers… well, secret. Since <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/212305/will-the-secret-of-the-secret-hats-be-revealed-after-the-end-of-winter-bash">the community asked so nicely</a>, it’s now time to reveal the mysteries of the secret hats! In ascending order of rarity:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://winterbash2013.stackexchange.com/chuck-yeager">Chuck Yeager</a> was the most commonly earned secret hat, awarded first to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/201359/oscar-lopez">Óscar López</a> - the very first user to discover a secret hat. This hat was awarded to users who answered a question within an hour of it being posted, with their answer scoring 2 or more.</li>
<li><a href="http://winterbash2013.stackexchange.com/with-great-power">With Great Power</a> was awarded to moderators (elected or pro tem), former moderators, and Stack Exchange employees.</li>
<li>Those who earned three hats in a single day earned <a href="http://winterbash2013.stackexchange.com/johnny-threehats">Johnny Three-hats</a> for their trouble.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://winterbash2013.stackexchange.com/ghost-of-winterbash-past">Ghost of Winter Bash Past</a> appeared only to those who earned a Necromancer badge.</li>
<li><a href="http://winterbash2013.stackexchange.com/ig88">IG-88</a> was a <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/IG-88_assassin_droid">less well-known bounty hunter</a>, and the hat that bears his name went to users who tried for a bounty, but didn&#8217;t win it.</li>
<li><a href="http://winterbash2013.stackexchange.com/im-not-listening">I’m Not Listening</a> was awarded to users who rejected a suggested edit on their own post.</li>
<li>For <a href="http://winterbash2013.stackexchange.com/i-see-your-point">I See Your Point</a>, users had to leave 5 comments on a site meta, each comment scoring 2 or more.</li>
<li><a href="http://winterbash2013.stackexchange.com/before-it-was-cool">Before It Was Cool</a> was awarded to forward-thinking users who asked a question with a brand new tag (that was not deleted or removed).</li>
<li><a href="http://winterbash2013.stackexchange.com/eureka">Eureka!</a> was awarded manually by SE staff to users who correctly determined (or guessed) the trigger for any of the secret hats.</li>
<li><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://winterbash2013.stackexchange.com/don-draper">Don Draper</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">, in homage to everyone&#8217;s favorite smooth-talking ad man, went to users who posted a community ad that received enough upvotes to be displayed on the site (usually 6). </span></li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, we need to send a special shout-out to the top hat earner across <a href="http://winterbash2013.stackexchange.com/leaderboard/network">the entire Stack Exchange network</a>. <strong>This user earned a whopping 44 hats</strong> &#8211; all of the hats they were eligible for, missing only With Great Power due to not being a moderator. Please join me in giving the eminent <a href="http://anime.stackexchange.com/users/24/logan-m">Logan M</a> a hearty round of applause!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="logan m is winnar" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3HmPN.png" /></p>
<p>Honorable mention is due to <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/178438/manishearth">Manishearth</a>, who held the network-wide lead for almost the entire duration of Winter Bash and was only edged out in the final hours by Logan M&#8217;s 44th hat. Well done to you both!</p>
<p>Lastly, we send our gratitude to each and every one of our users for the tireless and high-quality work you do throughout the year, even when there aren&#8217;t any hats to earn. Winter Bash is our chance to kick off our shoes and have some fun during the holiday season, and we hope you enjoyed it! The whole Stack Exchange team wishes everyone a happy and healthy 2014. That&#8217;s all, folks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a time of year of traditions and celebrations — and we have a tradition at Stack Exchange where we set this time aside each year to give back to the groups and organizations that need our help. Each year, we reach out to our moderators and offer to make <strong>a $100 donation to charity on behalf of each moderator for their Stack Exchange community.</strong> It&#8217;s just a small gesture of thanks for the tremendous amount of work every community has contributed to make this entire thing possible.</p>
<p>This &#8220;giving back&#8221; program actually goes waaay back to the beginning when we started with only 18 moderators and three sites. As our ranks grew, so did the donations. So on behalf of the <strong>375 moderators this year,</strong> we have made the following donations to charity:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14333" alt="SE Gives Back 2013 Blog" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/SE-Gives-Back-2013-Blog2.png" width="642" height="433" /></p>
<p>It is also important to remember and support the tools and organizations that make what we do possible, so we also made the following donations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HAProxy — $1,000.00</strong></li>
<li><strong>jQuery Foundation — $1,000.00</strong></li>
<li><strong>Linux Foundation — $1,000.00</strong></li>
<li><strong>OpenSTV, the voting engine that drives our elections — $1,000.00</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we continue to be a <strong><a href="http://www.mathjax.org/stack-exchange-continues-as-mathjax-partner-2/">MathJax Partner</a></strong> with a donation of <strong>$20,000</strong> in our commitment to helping math and science communities on the web.</p>
<p>As we approach 2014, I think a lot about what we have built here together. I think about the fact that this is all made possible by people who DONATE their time and GIVE freely their knowledge to benefit <em>future</em> readers who come here seeking help. It&#8217;s <em>your</em> contributions here that make all this possible. It&#8217;s what keeps the lights on and the wheels turning… and what makes this small gesture of giving back possible.</p>
<p>I take a lot of pride in what we do — and you should, too. This giving back program is just one of the many things we as a community do that is easy to feel pretty good about. It makes me delighted to be a part of this organization and part of a community that works so hard to help people they will probably never meet.</p>
<p>Take care, and see you in 2014!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Ahh, the wintry season&#8230;</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The gatherings of family and friends, the giving and receiving of gifts, the making and/or breaking of New Year&#8217;s resolutions &#8211; however you and yours celebrate, the end of a calendar year heralds many traditions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here at Stack Exchange, we wanted to get each of you an awesome, personal gift, and mail it to you as our way of saying &#8220;thanks.&#8221; But our accountant pointed out that there are 4.5 million of you, which promptly reminded us that the holidays aren&#8217;t about <em>gifts. </em>The <em>real</em> spirit of the holidays can only be captured with&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/header.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-14271" alt="header" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/header.png" width="600" /></a></p>
<h2>Hats!</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s right: Winter Bash is back for another three weeks of millinery-related holiday fun.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s new, you ask?</h2>
<p><strong>New hats:  </strong>There are over 30 new hats to earn this year (with many thanks to contract designer <a href="http://www.eliasstein.com/">Elias Stein</a>). And by &#8220;hats,&#8221; we of course mean, &#8220;things you can stick on your avatar&#8217;s face.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/6-hats.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14286" alt="6 hats" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/6-hats.png" width="455" height="306" /></a></p>
<p>And it&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that there just might be a couple of secret ones, too. (By &#8220;it&#8217;s possible,&#8221; we mean  &#8220;there definitely are, because we made them, like with computer code and everything, so there&#8217;s not really much doubt whatsoever.&#8221;)</p>
<p><strong>Hats are transferrable:</strong> What? No, you can&#8217;t <em>sell</em> them to each other.<strong> <strong>Hats are transferrable across sites! </strong></strong>You read that correctly: this year, if you earn a hat on any site, you can wear it on any participating Stack Exchange site. This was one of our most asked-for feature requests after last year&#8217;s event, and it&#8217;s a great way for everyone to highlight their achievements on their favorite site across the network.</p>
<p><strong>Hat position is adjustable on your face: </strong>You remember how crushed you were after finally earning a mustache &#8220;hat,&#8221; only to discover that on <em>your</em> avatar, it was basically an <em>extremely</em> dapper unibrow? NEVER AGAIN.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/don-draper-position.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-14273 aligncenter" title="such move. very fit. wow." alt="" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/don-draper-position.png" width="409" height="212" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can finally reposition hats in the box until Don Draper&#8217;s suit fits as well it fits him. (I know, I know&#8230; &#8220;it&#8217;s not a suit; it&#8217;s a carousel.&#8221; Give it a rest, Don. Not everything is a carousel.)</p>
<p>Winter Bash 2013 will run from Monday 16 December 2013 through Friday 3 January 2014. During that time, participate on any Stack Exchange site to earn awesome hats (and other accessories!) Each hat has a different activity to trigger it. You can see all the hats and their triggers on the <a href="http://winterbash2013.stackexchange.com/">Winter Bash 2013 homepage</a>. Still have questions? Of the kind that get asked&#8230; frequently?  Check out the  <a href="http://winterbash2013.stackexchange.com/faq">Winter Bash FAQ</a></p>
<p>All the hats will go back into storage at the end of Winter Bash, so get out there, earn some hats, and show them off while you can! Just be careful. We paid a deposit on them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The top bar of a Stack Exchange site has always been a bit of an odd place. It somehow combines user info, navigation, search, and a one-size-fits-all popup that includes hot network questions, a list of 100+ Stack Exchange sites, personal inbox messages, and other system notifications (lovingly referred to as <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/search?q=StackExchange%E2%84%A2+MultiCollider+SuperDropdown%E2%84%A2">The StackExchange™ MultiCollider SuperDropdown™</a>).</p>
<p>It was, in retrospect, overdue for a face-lift which is why we’re excited to roll out a new top bar this week.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZXNdN.png"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8tGcN.png" style="width: 703px; max-width: 703px" /></a></p>
<h2 style="clear: both">A Bigger, Blacker Bar</h2>
<p>The first thing you’ll notice is that <strong>it’s really black</strong>*. When we originally conceived of the top bar with the Stack Exchange logo (way back in <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/network-central-stackexchange-com/">Ye Olde 2010</a>), one of the main goals was to mark each site as a Gen-u-wine™ Stack Exchange site. Since then, however, we’ve created unique designs for over 40 different sites, and the Stack Exchange logo has started to get a bit&#8230; lost.
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XjSC7.png"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XjSC7.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a></p>
<p>So, in the redesigned top bar, we wanted to make sure that it would look the same across all sites, and make it obvious that you’re on a Stack Exchange site. It turns out that when you try to pick a color to match 40 different site designs, you quickly realize you only have one real choice: black.</p>
<p><sup>* <a href="http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/3/jin">Jin</a> points out that technically it&#8217;s not quite black: it’s #212121.</sup></p>
<h2>New Achievements popup</h2>
<p>The biggest addition to the top bar is the brand new Achievements popup. Previously, if you wanted to know your reputation on every site you were active on, you had to visit <em>every one of those sites</em>. This led to some of us, well, compulsively cycling through sites and refreshing to see if we&#8217;d gained any rep. Now, there&#8217;s one convenient place to check from whatever site you happen to be on:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6t7Oe.png"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6t7Oe.png" style="width: 425px"/></a></p>
<p>This new popup includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reputation counter at the top which sums <strong>all reputation</strong> you’ve gained on <strong>all sites</strong> since the last time you checked, updated in <strong>real-time</strong></li>
<li>Entries for reputation, badge, and privilege notifications, grouped by post and time</li>
<li>A summary of reputation gained today</li>
<li>Aggregation from every site in the network in one place</li>
</ul>
<p>This should make it <em>much easier</em> to keep track of your reputation and badges across all the sites that you are active on.</p>
<h2>New Sites List (aka “The Site Switcher”)</h2>
<p>The old list of sites has gotten a new layout and is now its own distinct popup. The idea is to make it easy to switch between sites if you participate on several, or to find a new site that you don’t participate on regularly:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gVhww.png"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gVhww.png" style="width: 650px" /></a></p>
<p>In the new “Site Switcher” you’ll find:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current site at the top, with meta, chat, and blog links for the current site (and Stack Overflow Careers when on Stack Overflow)</li>
<li>A list of your top 5 sites, ordered by reputation*, with your reputation for each</li>
<li>A searchable list of all sites, with a short description of each</li>
</ul>
<p><sup>* We’ll probably let you customize this list in the near future, so you can include sites you like to watch but don’t have much reputation on.<br />
</sup></p>
<h2>New Global Inbox</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/new-global-inbox/">Global Inbox</a> has been split out into its own popup as well, instead of a subsection of the Stack Exchange popup:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OXLSb.png"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/OXLSb.png" style="width: 650px; text-align: center;" /></a></p>
<p>We’ve gotten rid of the confusing distinction between “inbox” and “notifications”. All messages will now appear in the inbox, except for reputation and badge events which are in the new Achievements popup. Inbox items also now have a new layout, which should be easier to scan.</p>
<h2>Feedback Welcome</h2>
<p>There are a few smaller changes to mention as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name has been replaced with your picture, to make it easier to recognize at a glance that you’re signed in as you (and because some longer names just don’t fit).</li>
<li>The help link is now a dropdown with links to the tour and the help center, with a short explanation of what each is.</li>
<li>Click areas for everything are now the full-size of the row, to make them easier to click or tap on mobile.</li>
<li>The <strong>hot network questions have moved to the sidebar</strong> on the homepage, since they aren’t really navigation or notifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new top bar will be rolling out network-wide, including <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com">Area 51</a> and <a href="http://stackexchange.com">stackexchange.com</a>, in the next few weeks. As always, <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/tags/top-bar">meta</a> is the place to go for feedback, suggestions, and bug reports.</p>

Today&#8217;s episode is brought to you by <a href="http://reddit.com/r/husky" target="_blank">/r/husky</a>!</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ll start out with <b>Site Milestones</b>. We have one: <a href="http://ham.stackexchange.com/?utm_source=seblog&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=podcast&amp;utm_content=podcast54" target="_blank">Ham Radio</a> will be in public beta by the time this podcast goes live. Turns out there are tons of ham radio enthusiasts even today. <a href="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc58hpTHQ81qiau0f.gif" target="_blank">Ham</a>!</li>
<li><b>New Features</b>
<ul>
<li>The big thing we&#8217;re currently working on is the new topbar. It hasn&#8217;t changed in years&#8230; until now! David walks us through the new features on the upcoming new version. You can <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/198613/feedback-request-new-top-bar-and-multicollider-redesign?utm_source=seblog&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=podcast&amp;utm_content=podcast54" target="_blank">see our mockups on MSO</a>.</li>
<li>We finally released our open source status dashboard, Opserver. It&#8217;s got all sorts of awesome stuff, and <a href="https://github.com/opserver/Opserver" target="_blank">you can check it out</a>.</li>
<li>We&#8217;re still working on our mobile apps for Android and iOS. The Android alpha is out, and <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/190200/help-us-test-the-alpha-version-of-our-android-app?utm_source=seblog&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=podcast&amp;utm_content=podcast54" target="_blank">you can sign up</a> - it&#8217;s great. The iOS alpha is coming soon(ish), so keep an eye out for signups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let&#8217;s talk to our guest, Sara J. Chipps! (She&#8217;s impressed with the legitimacy and professionalism of our podcast setup.) She&#8217;s a cofounder of <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/" target="_blank">Girl Develop It</a>, a system of low-cost software development classes geared toward women (but guys are welcome too). It&#8217;s judgement-free, for total beginners who want to take their first few steps into the world of software development.</li>
<li>Sara recently left her role as CTO of <a href="http://www.levo.com/" target="_blank">Levo League</a> to focus on getting Girl Develop It&#8217;s board and 501(c)(3) status together (Levo League is a professional community for Generation Y women, and it is awesome).</li>
<li>This fall has been the <a href="http://sarajchipps.com/speaking" target="_blank">Sara Chipps world tour</a> - she&#8217;s been traveling all around to talk about hacking hardware with JavaScript. Check out <a href="http://nodebots.io/" target="_blank">NodeBots</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five" target="_blank">Johnny-five</a>. Sara, David, and Michael are all big nerds about hacking hardware. Check out <a href="http://rbrtr.com/post/44142337865/dorby-the-doorbot" target="_blank">Dorby the DoorBot</a> (<a href="https://github.com/LevoLeague/dorby" target="_blank">github</a>) and the <a href="http://developers.levoleague.com/post/39445070833/open-sourcing-our-arduino-powered-christmas-sweater" target="_blank">Christmas sweater that talks to the internet</a>.
<ul>
<li>Relevant: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYpKZx090UE" target="_blank">A Hundred People Coming Out of a Factory: The Movie!</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Moving on: let&#8217;s talk about women in technology. In 1984, 37% of CS degrees went to women. In 1998, it was 34%. In 2010-11, it was 12%.  Sara walks us through some of the stuff she&#8217;s working on that will make technology visible and appealing to girls and young women (and wearable technology that isn&#8217;t ugly).</li>
<li>Practically, what can we as humans be doing now to help the situation better for women developers?
<ul>
<li>Getting involved in projects that are already happening is a great way to start.<a href="http://www.girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a> and <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/" target="_blank">Black Girls Code</a> are good resources</li>
<li><a href="http://2013.jsconf.eu/" target="_blank">JSConf EU</a> has started reaching out to women to find speakers and had a 50/50 conference.</li>
<li>Sara says another important aspect of workplace diversity is keeping them on your team: praise them publicly, and redirect them privately.</li>
<li>And get rid of the <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/Feb-17.html" target="_blank">Well, Actually</a> culture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can Stack Overflow specifically help the situation?
<ul>
<li>We currently do an okay job of creating a safe space for everyone and putting our emphasis on the content of a post instead of the person who posted it.</li>
<li>The &#8220;over-moderation&#8221; we&#8217;re often criticized accidentally helps a lot with these issues, too &#8211; it makes us focus only on merit.</li>
<li>Sara says we should consider hiring beginner developers and training them ourselves if we aren&#8217;t getting enough applications from female senior-level developers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Sara, David, and Michael are all big nerds about hacking hardware. Check out Dorby the DoorBot (github) and the Christmas sweater that talks to the internet.

Moving on: let&#8217;s talk about women in technology. In 1984, 37% of CS degrees went to women. In 1998, it was 34%. In 2010-11, it was 12%.  Sara walks us through some of the stuff she&#8217;s working on that will make technology visible and appealing to girls and young women (and wearable technology that isn&#8217;t ugly).
Practically, what can we as humans be doing now to help the situation better for women developers?

Getting involved in projects that are already happening is a great way to start.Girls Who Code and Black Girls Code are good resources
JSConf EU has started reaching out to women to find speakers and had a 50/50 conference.
Sara says another important aspect of workplace diversity is keeping them on your team: praise them publicly, and redirect them privately.
And get rid of the Well, Actually culture.


How can Stack Overflow specifically help the situation?

We currently do an okay job of creating a safe space for everyone and putting our emphasis on the content of a post instead of the person who posted it.
The &#8220;over-moderation&#8221; we&#8217;re often criticized accidentally helps a lot with these issues, too &#8211; it makes us focus only on merit.
Sara says we should consider hiring beginner developers and training them ourselves if we aren&#8217;t getting enough applications from female senior-level developers.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve spent a good portion of the year trying to build out our teams to handle the increasing load of work here at Stack Exchange. A big part of this has involved bringing on new community managers: with both a larger number of sites *and* greater numbers of users on those sites, we hadn&#8217;t exactly been keeping up with the demand for help and guidance across the network. <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/05/welcome-tim-post-our-latest-community-manager/">Tim Post</a> signed on in the spring, followed by <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/08/please-welcome-jon-ericson-community-manager/">Jon Ericson</a>, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/08/introducing-gabe-the-smiling-community-manager/">Gabe Koscky</a> and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/09/community-management-by-popular-demand-kevin-chang-joins-the-team/">Pops &#8220;Kevin&#8221; Chang</a>. </p>
<p>Community Management at Stack Exchange is primarily a support role: assist folks in learning how to use the software, then help them learn to work together as they work to build something awesome. Our goal is to <i>facilitate</i> more than to dictate: if you&#8217;ve spent some time on a mature site, you know what we&#8217;re all working toward, but sometimes folks need a bit of help figuring out how to get there. Jon compares the job to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai">the art of bonsai</a>: patient observation, deliberate and judicious intervention and correction, more patient observation. We&#8217;ve been very lucky to attract so many patient, observant gardeners thus far, and I&#8217;m excited to announce that we&#8217;ve just hired one more:</p>
<p><a title="I'm not a robot, but I do enjoy their music." href="http://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/19253/ana-hevesi"><img style="float: left; width: 256px; margin-right: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 5px; border: 1px solid black;" alt="" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aEJYem.png" /></a> <b><a href="http://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/19253/ana-hevesi">Ana Hevesi</a></b> was raised in New York and socialized on The Internet as much as in “real life”. She grew to be wildly fascinated with how social norms developed on the web, finding the factors that led people to bond, collaborate or conflict with one another to be endlessly intriguing. She was a drama major at a competitive performing arts high school before studying web design and development in college. Dropping out to pursue a more self-directed path as a programmer, Ana attended events and got to know people within the (then rather small) New York tech community. Her new friends threw a wrench into her dev career plans by repeatedly asking for help in managing their relationships with customers. She was hired as the first community manager at Shapeways, helping designers and engineers share their 3D printing expertise and sell their designs. It was at Shapeways where Ana was first introduced to Stack Exchange, observing with interest our approach to community development. She gained further experience in community management at Nodejitsu, as well as knowledge of running a tech support team and the idiosyncrasies of the JavaScript and Node.js communities.</p>
<p>Ana has a keen eye for patterns in social interaction, and delights in finding ways to help folks work together more effectively. When she&#8217;s not working, she can be found hanging out in her Brooklyn neighborhood, finding the weirdest and most fun electronic music, hacking on small projects, organizing developer conferences, or digging into a sci-fi novel or a book about behavioral psych.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still in the process of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Y2nPHYpmXc">introducing</a> Ana to all of our communities, so please join me in giving her a warm welcome when she drops in on yours.</p>

<h1>Summary of Amazon Remnant Ad Experiment</h1>
<h2>The Motivation</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/08/podcast-64/" target="_blank">Podcast 64</a>,         Jeff talked about turning off AdSense because of the pitifully low payouts. Like   all publishers, Stack Overflow fills its premium inventory with direct sales and         is therefore left with remnant inventory to be filled by either an ad network or         house ads. I confidently told Jeff that I could build <em>something</em> that beat        AdSense. *  </p>
<p>After discussing a few alternatives, we decided that advertising programming         books from Amazon would be a good experiment. Hence, the Stack Overflow “rads”         (Remnant Advertising System) was born.</p>
<p><small>* This is not a boastful claim, since AdSense pays an       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_impression" target="_blank">effective CPM</a> of         less than $0.01. Any idiot can beat AdSense.</small></p>
<h2>The Setup</h2>
<p>Rads has three main components:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <b>spider</b> which uses the            <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html" target="_blank">             Amazon Product Advertising API</a> to crawl the Amazon product catalog.</li>
<li>A <b>website</b> which renders an advertisement based on Stack Overflow tags.</li>
<li>Some <b>analytics</b> to determine which ads, books, and tags are most             effective. </li>
</ol>
<p>The spider was fed the top 5000 tags on Stack Overflow. For each tag, it         preformed a keyword search on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?node=5" target="_blank">“Computers &amp; Internet” node</a>, returning the top         10 books with five-star reviews, sorted by number of reviews. </p>
<p>Stack Overflow has two separate ad units: an IAB-standard leaderboard (728x90)         that is displayed below the question, but <em>only to anonymous users</em>, and a 250x220         sidebar unit that is displayed to all users. Several different creative         templates were split-tested against one another. </p>
<p>One problem with Amazon is that you can only make purchases in six countries. So         any visitors who were not from the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany or Japan         would not be able to make purchases, and would, by definition, provide $0 in         revenue. So tracking by country would be important. </p>
<p>On September 12, 2009 we turned rads on, and it served ads until October 21. </p>
<h2>The Results</h2>
<h3>Week One</h3>
<p>         Initial results were promising: the ads were getting a 0.6% CTR. (In online         advertising, a 1% click-through-rate is considered        <em>very good</em>, so to hit 0.6% out of the         gates was encouraging.)    </p>
<p>         Well, the <em>leaderboard</em> ads were getting         0.6%. The <em>sidebar</em> ads were seeing less         than 0.1% CTR. We quickly dropped the sidebar units to focus on the         leaderboards.</p>
<p>         We initially were using the Coding Horror affiliate account, so it wasn’t         possible to get an accurate measure of conversion (the number of clicks that         turn into Amazon purchases). The Coding         Horror account gets 8% – 10% conversion, so I thought we were well on our way to         $1 CPMs, a whopping 100x better than AdSense. (0.6% CTR * 9% conversion * $1.85         per order = $1 per 1000 impressions)</p>
<h3>Not so fast...</h3>
<p>         Boy, was I was wrong. </p>
<p>         Firstly, the 0.6% CTR was fleeting; after users got over the initial delight of         seeing a new kind of ad, the CTR settled at 0.2%. </p>
<p>         Secondly, the conversion estimates were <em>wildly</em>         different between Jeff’s blog and Stack Overflow. Once we wired up a         dedicated affiliate account, we learned that less than 0.5% of the Stack Overflow users who clicked through to Amazon actually bought the book. The $1 CPM was looking more like a $0.01 CPM; no better than AdSense.</p>
<p>         Thankfully, the Cost-Per-Action advertising universe has developed a few tricks         over the years to combat this exact problem of low conversion. The key is to         lure the user in with baby steps. This is why so many online sites will merely         ask for your name or gender, as a way to essentially        <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnjaUoR15dU" target="_blank">Jedi Mind Trick</a> you         into eventually signing up for their service.    </p>
<h3>One last tweak</h3>
<p>         In October, we added an interstitial: clicking on an ad would take you to a         dedicated StackOverflow page, telling you about the book, and other books, and         only <em>then</em> could you click through to         Amazon (<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/all/javascript" target="_blank">example</a>).         This increased conversion to about 2.5%, with only a negligible impact on CTR.         This lifted the CPM to about $0.06. We         could have done more of this kind of lead qualification, but it’s a slippery         slope, and pretty soon you might be telling people that if they        <a href="http://www.mikeonads.com/2007/03/01/punch-the-monkey/" target="_blank">punch the monkey</a>         they win a free programming book!    </p>
<p>         On top of the low CPMs, Amazon can only sell to users in six countries,         representing 43% of the Stack Overflow traffic (and only 32% of the clicks!).          Even if we had managed to lift CPMs as high as, say,  $0.20, we still         wouldn&#39;t have been able to hit Jeff&#39;s minimum revenue threshold of $1000 per         month.  </p>
<p>         So, the experiment was ultimately a failure, but hopefully there are some         lessons that others can glean from the exercise and the data.</p>

<p>Notice that <strong>68% of the clicks were from non-revenue countries</strong>.         If only there had been a way to make money off those clicks... time perhaps for         <a href="http://amazon.in" target="_blank">amazon.in</a> to open?</p>

## (Working Name)

This is a prototype for a new blog in the Stack Overflow ecosystem centered on developer topics.

## Getting Started
This blog runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). If you are actively involved in improving the infrastructure of this project, you should read the documentation for these platforms thoroughly (they're pretty short as it is).

 - Git and GitHub
 - Adding yourself as a contributor
 - Adding posts with markdown
